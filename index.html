to write a proper, well-tested, simulation of the cube and cube movements. I am currently working on the back-end
representation of a 3x3 cube which I will then later create some interface for some interactive mode.</p><p>My first pass models the whole cube via what is on each of its 6 faces, but without the center cubie color as each move would leave it unchanged (but possibly rotated). The faces are labeled 0 to 5 (Bottom, Front, Right, Back, Left, Upper) and the colors are 1 through 6 (White, Blue, Red, Green, Orange, Yellow) respectively. The starting orientation of the cube puts the White face as the bottom face, and the Blue face as the front face (thus the Red face is on the right face).</p><p>This is a usable model, however, I am aware of the algebraic representation of the Rubik&rsquo;s cube and modeling it and its components with group actions. The downside of my model is that much of my code is repetitive and very dense and thus difficult to understand. A transformation associated with a single face rotating means describing how face of these cubies relates to the previous state, which means lots of array accesses everything is highly index sensitive - very prone to programmer error.</p><p>Fortunately, with sufficient testing it is possible for me to convince myself that I&rsquo;ve done it correctly. I tested certain properties of moves are true that should be true on a real cube.</p><p>As I continue to work on this, the next steps are:</p><ol><li>Making a decent tui visualizer of the current state (probably just going to print out a few grids with color options in Rust)</li><li>Making some sort of interactive mode taking in user input and spitting out the next cube state.</li><li>Finish reading this: &ndash; <a href=https://people.math.harvard.edu/~jjchen/docs/Group%20Theory%20and%20the%20Rubik%27s%20Cube.pdf>https://people.math.harvard.edu/~jjchen/docs/Group%20Theory%20and%20the%20Rubik%27s%20Cube.pdf</a> &ndash; which to rewrite the internal representation.</li><li>Track orientation of middle-of-face cubies (for those image puzzle cubes)</li><li>Consider how this can generalize to larger cubes</li></ol><p>And then other consideration in no particular order:</p><ul><li>Some sort of solver, maybe using some sort of Meet-In-The-Middle technique</li><li>Some sort of algorithm explorer</li><li>Better visualization for cube - perhaps even 3-D?</li></ul></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2023-11-25-compressor-functions/>Machine learning with gzip</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

In that paper, the authors presented a technique in which they would use a lossless compression function (gzip) + compressed distance metric (Normalized Compression Distance) + k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) for text topic classification. I liked this paper when I first learned of it because it is a parameter free model (hold the k hyperparameter), which is against the norm for other popular models in the space. I am no expert on NLP (although I have worked with some other areas of machine learning) but something that I can certainly appreciate in the era of multi-billion parameter language transformers is a simple idea applying existing tool in an effective manner.</p><p>One thing of note for this technique however is the runtime complexity of k-nn.
Computing gzip is performing the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate>DEFLATE algorithm</a> which is a two step process of Huffman coding and then LZ77. A number of places on the internet said that the runtime complexity of this was \( O(n) \), where n is the size of the uncompressed data. I could not find any credible sources doing out the analysis and when I started digging I gfound very few answers (some more information can be found at these two wikipedia articles: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding#Compression>Huffman coding</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78>LZ77</a>).</p><p>Instead I opted for a more empirical approach by just measuring gzip&rsquo;s performance on large bodies of data. Firstly, I generated large files of random data using the following command:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>for arg in 1K 5K 10K 50K 100K 250K 500K 1M 5M 10M 25M 50M 250M 500M 1G; do     head -c $arg &lt;/dev/urandom &gt;&#34;$arg.rand&#34;; done
</code></pre></div><p>and the getting gzip timing by running:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>for arg in 1K 5K 10K 50K 100K 250K 500K 1M 5M 10M 25M 50M 250M 500M 1G; do     time gzip &#34;$arg.rand&#34;; done
</code></pre></div><p>This gave me some data that I have saved here and ran a regression against. It looks like a linear regression is sufficient here and anything lower order (I tried \(log\, n \) for example did not work great). So for now gzip has empirically a linear runtime complexity (tested up to 1 gigabyte). The x-axis represents filesize before compression, the y-axis is seconds to compress (user + sys from time command) and the x-axis has a logarithmic scale.</p><iframe src=https://www.desmos.com/calculator/axfxot4dyf?embed width=500 height=500 style="border:1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe><p>The other components in this algorithm are interesting too. For example, the authors propose Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) as a means to compute the <code>distance</code> as used by k-nn. This metric is not complicated to compute, the formula for which is given in the paper, where \( C(x) \) is the compressed length of \(x\) and \(xy\) denotes the concatenation of \(x\) and \(y\).</p><p>\[ NCD(x, y) = \frac{C(xy) - \min \left\{C(x), C(y) \right\}}{\max \left\{C(x), C(y)\right\}} \]</p><p>Computing the Normalized Compression Distance between two texts \(x\) and \(y\) will require computing the compressed length of \(xy\) as well.</p><p>And of course, the aspects of an implementation of k-nn with its own runtime complexity as well. This I am choosing not to derive here out of respect for my time and the brevity of this article.</p><p>A few notes here at the end on this paper. They used the metric Normalized Compression Distance as a stand-in for <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3520.pdf>information distance</a> (or \(E(\cdot)\) which is uncomputable because of its dependence on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity>Kolmogorov complexity</a>. The idea is that as the compression ratio of gzip becomes higher, it will eventually approach \(K(\cdot)\), thus \(NCD\) approaches \(E\).</p><p>The next note I had here is a video on optimality and related to kolmogorov complexity (specifically on the algorithm proposed in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity#Uncomputability_of_Kolmogorov_complexity>uncomputability section</a> of that wikipedia article: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ONm1od1QZo">&ldquo;The most powerful (and useless) algorithm&rdquo; - polylog</a> and its percursor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrKlPzceeqc">&ldquo;The OPTIMAL algorithm for factoring!&rdquo; - polylog</a>.</p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2023-11-20-coursework-and-weekend/>Upcoming week of work</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

]</div></div><div><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I made it a habit to add something to this blog every couple of days. I was busy then (surprise!), I am busy now. What changed? Priorities. The phrase &ldquo;you have to <em>make</em> time for it&rdquo; was something that didn&rsquo;t sit well with me for a number of years. When I first heard the phrase, it was probably in reference to some responsibilities that I had shirked on, thus the negative association. I have come around to truly appreciate the phrase for what it is and use it myself. If I don&rsquo;t prioritize something, it will not happen. I will fill my time with other things first and whatever task it is will either be forgotten or discarded. I am not discarding a number of things, including this webpage. Eventually, using this page and others, I will organize and collate the important items in my life digitally. This will probably take a long time (probably a lifetime). For now here are a few projects of mine that I would like to showcase over the past few years particularly using the Rust programming language.</p><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/jack-champagne/rustlings>Rustlings Solutions Repository</a></li></ul><p>Here is my fork of the rustlings project with my solutions as patches applied on the trunk. I added a small bit of CI for Gitlab to ensure that my solutions complete the exercises correctly. I periodically update this by pulling the upstream changes into a staging branch, rebasing my changes onto that branch (fixing any conflicts that appear), making small tweaks to exercises that have been updated, getting CI to pass, then merging into the main branch. This means that I have quite a collection of my own solutions to a number of exercises that test knowledge on the basic components of the Rust programming language.</p><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/jack-champagne/ferrous-broadcast>Ferrous broadcast</a></li></ul><p>This project is simply a TCP server that takes messages sent over the socket to the server and resends it to all connected sockets/clients. It is a fun way to spin up a really small chat room really quickly (assuming that you can telnet over your local network and type in all the right ip addresses :-)). I was going to turn this project into something with a small tui (text user interface) but UI is never really my game.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/cs377-final-project>CS377 Final Project - Demo file system</a></li></ul><p>This project was my final project for the intro to operating systems course at University of Massachusetts Amherst. This undergrad course allowed for a project type of your choosing - as long as it was an individual project. Most of this course was done in C and C++. I wanted to do a Rust rewrite of one of the projects, and after some debating on which project could remain as faithful to the original implementation, I decided the filesystems project was a good start. The implemented file system is extraordinarily limited, and a file is used as a proxy for an actual block device, but it does have some of the basic components of filesystems implemented (free block list, inodes, block pointers). It does not implement in its current state many essential features of modern filesystems such as directories, permissions, superblock(s), indirect blocks, journaling, etc. Finally, this project contains multiple layers: extensive documentation, unit/system testing, github ci/cd, and a few other tools. This implementation also attempts to remain on feature parity with the project itself. This cause me to learn about the #[repr(C)] macro in Rust which forces the underlying representation to match that of a C struct. Initially, I got the filesystem to work, but because the Rust representation of data and the C representation of data were no identical, the data written to the proxy block device was different between the two implementations.</p><p>I have a few other small project written in Rust that aren&rsquo;t worth sharing here - either because most of the code was derived from someone/somewhere else or because the project is so incomplete that it does not work/isn&rsquo;t worth sharing. A good example of this is the two-part project that initial motivated me to learn the Rust programming language: C library of datastructures as presented in CS187, and a C library of algorithms as presented in CS311. These two projects are related to eachother in that I wanted to use the datastructures library in the implementation of the algorithms library. Both I chose to write in C for a few reasons: practice in C, manually managing memory, difficulty, performance. These two projects never came to full fruition, however the datastructures project did make some strides (see <a href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/libds>libds</a>).</p><p>I lost some interest in the project when I started dealing with the dependency injection required for custom types. Say you&rsquo;re making a binary tree out of char[] types, how do you determine the strings ordinality? The answer is you can&rsquo;t for every type, at least not within the library. A way to do this is let the user specify their own comparison function and inject that function to be used inside the implementation of the binary tree. This uses functions pointers, &ldquo;void *&rdquo; types, and feels a little like bending C to feel more object oriented, all things that were displeasing to me even though they were (maybe) necessary evils. The answer for me here&mldr; a language that had a more comprehensive type system while still remaining low-level - thus Rust. Essentially, I wanted to be able to have the power of generics (like C++ templates really), without the horrors of C++. Eventually I will take those projects and resurrect them from the land of C and put them in Rust so that I may work past those barriers I ran into long ago, but for now I have much more pressing tasks to attend to.</p><p>The final word on Rust projects I have tried includes some very low level work trying to write something to make a disk image that boots via BIOS and then hangs, a dumb kernel if you will, to learn some of the necessary steps of booting to an operating system. I had a good name for this &lsquo;ferrOS&rsquo;, probably derived/inspired from <a href=https://github.com/ferrous-systems>ferrous-systems</a> and the work that I&rsquo;ve seen by folks like <a href=https://github.com/phil-opp>phil-opp</a> and <a href=https://github.com/japaric>japaric</a>. For some time I was following the blog by <em>phil-opp</em> <a href=https://os.phil-opp.com/>here</a>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the most complete list of Rust projects and information about them that I can gather for now.</p><ul><li>Jack</li></ul></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2023-11-1-cmu/>UMass -> Summer -> CMU</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

]</div></div><div><p>After years of work at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I graduated this past spring. I got to experience and learn at lot at UMass and will be looking back on it with rose-colored glasses. I had the opportunity to continue my studies and do a masters degree at UMass in computer science. Due to a program offered by the university, and my desire to join industry quickly, I opted for their accelerated Master&rsquo;s program. This required that I take graduate courses that were to be stripped from my undergraduate transcript and put onto my graduate transcript. Interestingly, most of the courses I ended up taking circa fall 2021 - spring 2023 were heavily skewed towards machine learning systems and data science but what I&rsquo;ve ended up enjoying in industry is working with embedded systems and hardware.</p><p>I took a number of courses that were heavily focused in theory (Algorithms for data science, Indep. Study, Quantum Information Systems, Cryptography) and some more practice oriented courses (Machine Learning, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, a number of mathematics courses). In the end my piece of advice to students at University of Massachusetts Amherst, particularly those following a similar path to my own, would be to not focus on perfection in coursework. Spend time around your classmates - some of the most creative, intelligent, and passionate individuals I have ever met I first started talking to when they sat next to me in class. If you are feeling particularly inspired, the university is perhaps one of the only places where you can take the helm (so to speak) and dive into something of your own. This path may seem risk and challenging, but if you do it for long enough and well enough (and you&rsquo;re lucky), you can become a researcher->Ph.D.->Post-Doc->Professor and get funding to work on something truly of your own making, how incredible!</p><p>A applied to a number of universities through the graduate application process, primarily focused on Master&rsquo;s programs in computer science and was accepted to University of California Los Angeles, Carnegie Mellon University, and my undergraduate institution University of Massachusetts Amherst. While this decision was difficult, especially since leaving UMass meant a more expensive and unfamiliar program, I did decide to attend CMU for a Master&rsquo;s in Software Engineering (focus in Embedded Systems). I have many people to thank for this process along the way which I will not list here.</p><p>The end of my undergraduate experience was particularly significant as it meant that my long time girlfriend and I would no longer have to be in a long-distance relationship. She, the incredible person she is, also decided that she would join me to Pittsburgh, something that I am grateful for. To kick off the summer, Lillian and I finally went on a road-trip that I had been planning for a few months across the United States. This is something that deserves its own post (or many!) to detail more about this trip. We traveled about across 25 U.S. states, over 10 national parks, a number of national monuments (I don&rsquo;t have a detailed list of these, there were many), 15,000 miles of driving, about 28 days of van-lifing inside of a converted SUV. I highly recommend it for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t tried: an impromptu trip with sufficient time set-aside but little to no constraints on where and when you can go (no reservations, appointments, etc). After this trip concluded, I spent a little time working in Burlington, VT at BETA technologies and then moved to Pittsburgh PA.</p><p>CMU has kept me incredibly busy so far. I am impressed and still overwhelmed by the sheer scale of resources, opportunities, and information that I am exposed to but I try to be a sponge for it all. Currently I am considering a number of different courses to take next semester as an elective (something quantum, something systems like O.S., something machine learning, something computer networking) but I do not have the information I need yet to make that decision. A stale blog that lacks recent posts should be deleted, thus here I am. And hopefully will be.</p><ul><li>Jack</li></ul></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2022-10-13-cloudflare/>Finally behind cloudflare</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

<a href=https://www.jackchampagne.com/desmos/>math animations</a> for some fun animations that aren&rsquo;t public facing.</p><p>This blog was a technical project that I am moving to my private server in order to have more control over the hosting and build process of the static pages.</p><p>Thank you!

I love open-source because the code is auditable, security can be reviewed just by looking at the source, the software isn&rsquo;t an opaque black box, and it creates a community around a piece of software.</p><p>Each one of these has side-effects that are, for the most part, beneficial to everyone.</p><ul><li>Privacy that is verifiable and trackable</li><li>Security through bug reports and whatever patching process the project has</li><li>The power of anyone being able to propose changes to ensure a piece of software is working as intended for whatever use case</li><li>Support through others on forums, community wikis, and project documentation</li></ul><p>The &lsquo;Free&rsquo; in free and open-source software does not primarily represent the price (although all free software does not cost money). The &lsquo;Free&rsquo; stands for <em>free</em>dom. That is, the freedom to use, distribute, modify software as you please. This is a beautiful thing. There is no such thing as &lsquo;sunsetting&rsquo; a free and open-source software project, the community of those who use the software have the freedom to maintain it. You are protected from feature regression of features that you need. Paywalls for features shouldn&rsquo;t be a thing, and if a project is truly free and open-source, you can modify it and redistribute as you wish.</p><p>In a sense, free and open-source software is like writing software where the code that gets put in is democratically accepted by a project community. If a project maintainer goes haywire and starts accepting questionably contributions and changes to their project, the community can make a fork. If the fork is truly better than the original, there is no reason why it can&rsquo;t become the dominant and most widely-used version.</p><p>I like machines, tools, and ideas that <strong>last forever</strong>. People buy lathes from the 1960s because they are reasonably accurate but will last forever. Free and open-source software are the <em>software tools</em> that will last me forever. Because of that I am willing to put in the time now to find, learn, and configure said software for a lifetime of utility.</p><ul><li>Jack</li></ul></div></div><div class=pagination-content><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">Pages</li><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-selected"><a href=/ class=pure-menu-link>First</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item><a href=/page/2/ class=pure-menu-link>2</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item><a href=/page/3/ class=pure-menu-link>3</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item><a href=/page/5/ class=pure-menu-link>Last</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=footer><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme repository"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/jack-champagne.github.io>GitHub</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme page on gohugo.io"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://themes.gohugo.io/slick>Slick</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title=Top><a class=pure-menu-link href=#>To Top</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="RSS Feed"><a href=/index.xml class=pure-menu-link>RSS</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item fix-cursor-pointer" title="Go to top"><a class=pure-menu-link id=btn-gototop><span class=fix-placement-up>&#8679;&#xfe0e;</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">&copy; 2023 &mdash; Jack Champagne — All rights reserved.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="pure-u-1-24 pure-u-md-5-24"></div></div></body></html>
