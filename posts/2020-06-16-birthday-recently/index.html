When I got home, my grandmother was down to visit. I learned how to make her incredible Kahlua cheesecake and spent time with her catching up. My dad announced on the 13th or the 14th that getting a dog this fall is almost certain. On the 14th, I got a terrible sunburn when me and my girlfriend went out to Saquish to look for moon snails and have a bit of a picnic.</p><p>On my birthday I recieved two gifts that I am looking forward to using. The first is an apple watch, which I am wearing right now. The second is a Kindle, which I would like to use to read in bed at night instead of my phone screen. Hopefully the display is not backlit like a normal lcd display and the tablet is suitable for nighttime reading. I also recieved new shoes from my mom which I have wanted badly these past couple of weeks.</p><p>As I get older, a birthday just feels like another normal day. If I was asked by someone how old I am, I&rsquo;d probably respond with 18 accidentally still. This is the reality but fortunately I have not gotten to the point where I say an age from two years ago. I have found some difficulty and trouble trying to motivate to do work. The tasks that I have set out at AirCycler seem very doable and are broken up into bite size chunks but I find the work to be less interesting than that which I decide to do for my own personal improvement.</p><p>Some things I wanted to jot down for some note taking:</p><ul><li>I started the cryptography and micro/macro economics course on Khan Academy earlier this summer. And have not been doing that recently. (At one point I found myself needing pen and paper to organize my thoughts for the cryptography and econ quizzes, which made it more difficult to do before bed and such)</li><li>I also have many other books I would like to read and <del>a Scientific American magazine</del> to get through as well. (10 python books to read)</li><li><del>I also want to note that my python script for sending me text from my computer does not work now for unknown reasons. I am unable to connect to gmail&rsquo;s smtp server.</del></li><li><del>I have not watched youtube in weeks&mldr; I&rsquo;m not sure how long it has been but life has felt more fulfilling, busy, and peaceful recently. I feel like I am taking care of the people around me better and sometimes I feel like I am taking care of myself better (although this morning I lay in bed for nearly an hour, a habit that I am going to start to break)</del></li><li>I want to start reading my next python book on my kindle</li><li>I want to clean the garage</li><li><del>I want to put a roof on the Green&rsquo;s Harbor trailhead sign (for my Eagle Scout project)</del></li><li>I want to get enough sleep and exercise every day! (Can track these things now using my apple watch)</li><li>I want to work 20 hours a week consistently and put away 25% of everything that I make.</li><li>I want to get more nighttime photography (Was about to last night but instead wrote a summary of campus&rsquo; plans to repopulate to my friends)</li><li><del>I want to clean my room again, there is too much on the walls</del></li><li><del>I want to set up a little stand at the base of my bed for a projector setup</del></li><li><del>I want to write more of these posts. (Am wondering right now if having this private information exposed is a privacy concern of mine.)</del></li><li><del>I want to create a comprehensive todo list focused around my health</del></li><li>I want to set up an r-pi cluster compute server</li><li>I want to get my part 107</li><li><del>I want to play more minecraft with my girlfriend</del></li><li><del>I want to spend more time on discord calls with friend and in-person risk-mitigated hangouts</del></li><li>I want to spend more time around Lillian&rsquo;s family to connect more</li><li>I want to program guis in flutter to try it out</li><li><del>I want to learn options and market information through Cboe and others</del></li><li>I want to play guitar more</li><li>I want to automate more of my life</li><li><del>I want to plan out Dyken pond trips with my friends this summer.</del></li><li>I want to bike more.</li><li><del>I want to go to bed earlier and get more sleep.</del></li><li>I want to have more time? Make more time</li><li><del>I want to camp and go on more hikes</del></li><li>I want to <em>clean</em> my mom&rsquo;s car</li><li><del>I want to see moon snails</del></li><li>I want to start my web programming course again on khan academy</li><li>I want to continue my python code-academy course (or find a different service)</li><li>I want to continue learning c and c++</li></ul><p>( 6-25-2020 )</p><ul><li>I want to give myself more time</li><li>I want to be the best that I can be.</li><li><del>I want to get right out of bed and wake up earlier (8am)</del></li></ul><p>I want a lot of things in life. And it always seems like there&rsquo;s just not enought time. One small thing at a time though, and I know it will get done. I know it will.</p><p>This could have a ton of tags but because of the nature of this list, I think I am going to keep it with only these.</p><p>Till next time,
- Jack</p></div></div><div class=footer><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme repository"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/jack-champagne.github.io>GitHub</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme page on gohugo.io"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://themes.gohugo.io/slick>Slick</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title=Top><a class=pure-menu-link href=#>To Top</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="RSS Feed"><a href=/index.xml class=pure-menu-link>RSS</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item fix-cursor-pointer" title="Go to top"><a class=pure-menu-link id=btn-gototop><span class=fix-placement-up>&#8679;&#xfe0e;</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">&copy; 2022 &mdash; Jack Champagne â€” All rights reserved.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="pure-u-1-24 pure-u-md-5-24"></div></div></body></html>
