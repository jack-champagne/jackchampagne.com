The &lsquo;Free&rsquo; stands for <em>free</em>dom. That is, the freedom to use, distribute, modify software as you please. This is a beautiful thing. There is no such thing as &lsquo;sunsetting&rsquo; a free and open-source software project, the community of those who use the software have the freedom to maintain it. You are protected from feature regression of features that you need. Paywalls for features shouldn&rsquo;t be a thing, and if a project is truly free and open-source, you can modify it and redistribute as you wish.</p><p>In a sense, free and open-source software is like writing software where the code that gets put in is democratically accepted by a project community. If a project maintainer goes haywire and starts accepting questionably contributions and changes to their project, the community can make a fork. If the fork is truly better than the original, there is no reason why it can&rsquo;t become the dominant and most widely-used version.</p><p>I like machines, tools, and ideas that <strong>last forever</strong>. People buy lathes from the 1960s because they are reasonably accurate but will last forever. Free and open-source software are the <em>software tools</em> that will last me forever. Because of that I am willing to put in the time now to find, learn, and configure said software for a lifetime of utility.</p><ul><li>Jack</li></ul></div></div><div class=footer><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme repository"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/jack-champagne.github.io>GitHub</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme page on gohugo.io"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://themes.gohugo.io/slick>Slick</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title=Top><a class=pure-menu-link href=#>To Top</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="RSS Feed"><a href=/index.xml class=pure-menu-link>RSS</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item fix-cursor-pointer" title="Go to top"><a class=pure-menu-link id=btn-gototop><span class=fix-placement-up>&#8679;&#xfe0e;</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">&copy; 2022 &mdash; Jack Champagne â€” All rights reserved.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="pure-u-1-24 pure-u-md-5-24"></div></div></body></html>
