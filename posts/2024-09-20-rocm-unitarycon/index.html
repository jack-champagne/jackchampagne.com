This sort of multiple dispatch across a defined interface (or Trait in Rust&rsquo;s case) might not be warranted here. Generally, a faithful Rust implementation of similar behavior would be in the form of an enum - with cases for each value (the overall type here being a group, and the enum variants would be the various groups I want to define). This is the idea of &ldquo;composition over inheritance&rdquo; here at work. The only issue is the extra information and constraints that the inner enum variants give on type operations. Because Rust&rsquo;s type system is so expressive, I was relying upon the compiler to (at compile time) throw errors if incompatble types (different groups) had operations defined against eachother.</p><p>I got pretty far with the last implementation - with nice working groups and compile time checked operations on those groups. The issue that stopped me for now was trying to define a direct product - which would also implement the group type, and all operations on it would be type checked at compile time (<strong>hard</strong>).</p><p>For summer updates, I will have to keep it brief - contact me directly if you want to know more. I worked an interesting embedded software position and had a really successful project outcome. Loved the folks I met and didn&rsquo;t have to move again (how great!).</p><p>In other updates, I recently attended the open-source quantum computing software ecosystem conference run by the <a href=https://unitary.fund>unitary fund</a>. It was a fantastic conference in Helsinki, mets lots of awesome people, and partook in the Finnish fondness for saunas. I do miss how well the suspensions on their public transit rail lines kept the car from reacting to bumps - I nearly fell asleep it was so quite and smooth.</p><p>Been playing a bit with ROCm recently and looking at the gaps that exist for it in its co-existence and fight for relevance against Nvidia&rsquo;s CUDA. I am optimistic, this sort of firmware and encouraging competition in this part of the tech landscape I am very much for. If I had additional time, I would try a become part of the folks that are working on improving this every day - Nvidia&rsquo;s moat here may not be as deep as the markets seem to think. I have also been playing with some of the Rust large language model stuff that&rsquo;s out there now (see <a href=https://github.com/floneum/floneum>kalosm and floneum</a>.</p><p>Till next time</p><ul><li>Jack</li></ul></div></div><div class=footer><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme repository"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/jack-champagne.github.io>GitHub</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme page on gohugo.io"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://themes.gohugo.io/slick>Slick</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title=Top><a class=pure-menu-link href=#>To Top</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="RSS Feed"><a href=/index.xml class=pure-menu-link>RSS</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item fix-cursor-pointer" title="Go to top"><a class=pure-menu-link id=btn-gototop><span class=fix-placement-up>&#8679;&#xfe0e;</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">&copy; 2024 &mdash; Jack Champagne â€” All rights reserved.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="pure-u-1-24 pure-u-md-5-24"></div></div></body></html>
