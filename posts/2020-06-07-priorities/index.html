About five days ago, I made a promise to myself after my last experiment with <em>quitting</em> youtube failed. I thought that I would be able to curb my Youtube habit by limiting myself to only watching what I came to the site to watch. This way I would not browse and fall victim to their powerful recommendation algorithm.</p><p>This failed, and it failed by slow loosening of the rules and gradual slippage back into prior habits. Because of this, I made a decision to <strong>stop</strong> watching Youtube completely for the time being. This means I cannot go on my laptop, cannot go on the app, cannot watch it on the Tv, and cannot watch a quick video that a friend may have sent me. It is a strict ban for probably forever. If I ever wanted to use the platform again, I am thinking of a couple of ways that I could do so in a completely non-addictive and fully informative matter. One method is that I must download the videos (that I was thinking of watching) first on to my device to seperate myself from the platform. I would not be allowed to let Youtube&rsquo;s algorithm serve me what to watch but instead I must know it beforehand. This will be far into the future where I can live completely seperate from the need to watch video.</p><p>On another note, I have been reading <em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</em> by Al Sweigart (which I will abbrv. as ABSP) and so far I have really enjoyed it. I am currently on the filesystem chapter and the section that details how to use python to compress (&ldquo;zip&rdquo;) files. I am looking forward to later chapters, particularly the ones on webscraping and <em>sending emails and texts</em> ðŸ˜® with python. Last night, on a short call with my friend Matt Keating, we discussed python and a few programming things over the phone while I toured the cathedral that he was building on the ski guys minecraft server. He reminded me of a website that I have been fond of but have only now come back to: <a href=https://projecteuler.net>Project Euler</a> is a collection of programming puzzles on algorithms, data-structures, optimization and more. Solving the problems it presents is a unique challenge (much like <a href=https://www.codeabbey.com/>Code Abbey</a> or <a href=https://code.golf/>Code Golf</a>) that is rewarding. I have signed back up and hopefully the python that I have learned from this book, I can properly apply for some good problem solving.</p><h3 id=priorites>Priorites</h3><p>A list of priorities is always important, especially for the person who likes to work on a thousand other problems before solving the big daunting problem that has been hanging over their head for weeks (me). I read an article this morning from Harvard Business Review about self-sabotaging behaviours which is what has inspired this section. So here is my current list of priorities to myself:</p><ol><li>My Health is most important and I think that focusing on this is one of the most valuable things I can do for myself. (Sleep, excersize, hygiene)</li><li>Staying away from all the time wasters (Youtube, Snapchat, etc&mldr;) and instead replacing them with something else, like reading out of ABSP.</li><li>Spending quality time with those around me (Family, friends, and my girlfriend)</li><li>Keeping my room clean and establishing a good routine</li></ol><p>And priorities to others:</p><ol><li>Get BubblesGUI working with a usable GUI for AirCycler (Simulator, Debugger, Testing)</li><li><del>Get a roof on the 1623 Trailhead sign (It&rsquo;s been nearly a year!)</del> (June 21st)</li><li>Clean up around the property (Duxbury, Berlin)</li></ol><p>Thinking about doing a power-hour week sometime soon: One article each day for a week that I just write down my thoughts and day in great detail. Just a thought for now.</p><p>Until later this week,
Jack</p></div></div><div class=footer><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme repository"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/jack-champagne.github.io>GitHub</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="Theme page on gohugo.io"><a class=pure-menu-link href=https://themes.gohugo.io/slick>Slick</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title=Top><a class=pure-menu-link href=#>To Top</a></li><li class=pure-menu-item title="RSS Feed"><a href=/index.xml class=pure-menu-link>RSS</a></li><li class="pure-menu-item fix-cursor-pointer" title="Go to top"><a class=pure-menu-link id=btn-gototop><span class=fix-placement-up>&#8679;&#xfe0e;</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal"><ul class=pure-menu-list><li class="pure-menu-item pure-menu-disabled">&copy; 2023 &mdash; Jack Champagne â€” All rights reserved.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="pure-u-1-24 pure-u-md-5-24"></div></div></body></html>
