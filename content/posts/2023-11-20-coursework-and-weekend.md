Have a good amount of large projects for my coursework coming along, thus will unfortunately be pretty busy. I am looking forward to heading to my mom's house for Thanksgiving this year. Lillian and I will probably get a real tree from the tree grove which we will decorate once we get back. Current ongoing projects for my coursework are the advanced formal methods project on LTSA, the quality assurance project on the card game 'Love Letter', and wrapping up some personal projects.

For some reason, ligatures are not supported on Emacs for the new font I was discussing in the last post [JuliaMono](2023-11-16-small-and-upcoming). I see that there are a few packages and setups that do have ligatures working (seems like nothing is out of the box for this feature) but none of them look super simple/appealing to me.

I enjoyed an older movie last weekend that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good comedy and a progressive tone: [Auntie Mame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auntie_Mame_(film)).

I am almost to the point where I *need* to clean out/up and backup my old PC. Its being converted into a Steam Big picture mode-esque machine and I will need to move all of my files off of it onto another machine. Hopefully, with a bit of effort, collecting all of these documents/files together, organizing them, and properly backing them up ([and up to the cloud](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf))
