The first version of this blog post was lost, which is sad because I am normally so good about having things autosaved. Anyways, the past two posts have been on the larger side and I tend to find that smaller posts suit my style, my free time, and my writing motivation. I have a few posts coming down the pipeline but the are a little big and I have some things that I want to share *now*. For example, check out this cool font that I have been trying out for the past few days:

[JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/)

I think it is easy to read and a bit more playful than my standard monospaced font for nearly everything in my life: RobotoMono Nerd Font Mono. Currently I am using this font in my emacs configuration as well as in my terminal emulator (kitty).
