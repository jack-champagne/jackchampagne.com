This site continues to evolve as I work on my self-hosting project at home with gateway. I have transitioned most of the notetaking that I did here into Obsidian because of multiple reasons including quality, markdown linking support, graph view, and more.

One important note that I want to make is to check out
[math animations](https://www.jackchampagne.com/desmos/) for some fun animations that aren't public facing.

This blog was a technical project that I am moving to my private server in order to have more control over the hosting and build process of the static pages.

Thank you!
Jack
