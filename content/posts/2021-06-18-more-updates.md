Watching a lot of George Hotz recently. I am deeply inspired by his skills and his constant focus on his work. comma.ai and his new streams about the cherry computer are deeply interesting to me and I find that his content in general relates very well with my studies in statistics, mathematics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and general computer science.

I started my REU (TRIPODS @ University of Massachusetts, Amherst) on Monday the 7th and since then have trained multiple models on my computer (actually my laptop because it has cuda cores). I am working on implementing a g-convolution into a new network to try and improve my preformance on a rotated and mirrored MNIST dataset. I haven't quite figured out how each of the dimensions to my convolution is going to fit into the training but progress is coming along.

In other news, I am not so sure I want to stay with hugo. The popularity of jekyll really helps with finding themes and general documentation for me.

Been a while
