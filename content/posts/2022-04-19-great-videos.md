Its been 3 months...

Since my family moved, I have not been home (due to school) long enough to set up my server again. Anyways a few things have happened. Last Tuesday I had an interview with BETA Technologies for the embedded systems team. The next day (Wed, 4/13/22) I got the offer! Super excited about that. Talked to Jason Wolfson at AirCycler today to let him know that I am not coming back and chatted about aircraft for a bit. I have stumbled across another video that I find extremely good and was inspired to make a curated list of some of the best youtube videos I have watched over the years. The videos will be loosely educational, hopefully leaving the watchers with a sense of satisifaction and having learned something new or seen something beautiful

Thank you!
