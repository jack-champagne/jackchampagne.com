Cloudflare always seemed like an interesting company/service to me, especially the [lava lamps](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/) that they have. I finally put my website behind cloudflare (for a number of reasons) and configured everything earlier today to get it working again. The main sticking point for me was Github re-issuing an SSL certificate for the website after the DNS change. I also added an email address that forwards to my personal email with a jackchampagne.com extension.

The main reason that I put the website behind cloudflare was because of their Yubikeys offer (10 for $10 each discounted price). I have always wanted a set of yubikeys but found them to be cost prohibitive.
