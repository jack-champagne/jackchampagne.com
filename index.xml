&lt;p>I am not sure in which context I originally stumbled across the coni ept presented in &lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426.pdf">this paper&lt;/a>. In that paper, the authors presented a technique in which they would use a lossless compression function (gzip) + compressed distance metric (Normalized Compression Distance) + k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) for text topic classification. I liked this paper when I first learned of it because it is a parameter free model (hold the k hyperparameter), which is against the norm for other popular models in the space. I am no expert on NLP (although I have worked with some other areas of machine learning) but something that I can certainly appreciate in the era of multi-billion parameter language transformers is a simple idea applying existing tool in an effective manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing of note for this technique however is the runtime complexity of k-nn.
Computing gzip is performing the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate">DEFLATE algorithm&lt;/a> which is a two step process of Huffman coding and then LZ77. A number of places on the internet said that the runtime complexity of this was \( O(n) \), where n is the size of the uncompressed data. I could not find any credible sources doing out the analysis and when I started digging I found very few answers (some more information can be found at these two wikipedia articles: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding#Compression">Huffman coding&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">LZ77&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead I opted for a more empirical approach by just measuring gzip&amp;rsquo;s performance on large bodies of data. Firstly, I generated large files of random data using the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">for arg in 1K 5K 10K 50K 100K 250K 500K 1M 5M 10M 25M 50M 250M 500M 1G; do head -c $arg &amp;lt;/dev/urandom &amp;gt;&amp;#34;$arg.rand&amp;#34;; done
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and the getting gzip timing by running:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">for arg in 1K 5K 10K 50K 100K 250K 500K 1M 5M 10M 25M 50M 250M 500M 1G; do time gzip &amp;#34;$arg.rand&amp;#34;; done
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This gave me some data that I have saved here and ran a regression against. It looks like a linear regression is sufficient here and anything lower order (I tried \(log n \) for example did not work great. So for now gzip has empirically a linear runtime complexity (tested up to 1 gigabyte). The x-axis represents filesize before compression, the y-axis is seconds to compress (user + sys from time command) and the x-axis has a logarithmic scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/axfxot4dyf?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>The other components in this algorithm are interesting too. For example, the authors propose Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) as a means to compute the &lt;code>distance&lt;/code> as used by k-nn. This metric is not complicated to compute, the formula for which is given in the paper, where \( C(x) \) is the compressed length of \(x\) and \(xy\) denotes the concatenation of \(x\) and \(y\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ NCD(x, y) = \frac{C(xy) - \min \left\{C(x), C(y) \right\}}{\max \left\{C(x), C(y)\right\}} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Computing the Normalized Compression Distance between two texts \(x\) and \(y\) will require computing the compressed length of \(xy\) as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the aspects of an implementation of k-nn with its own runtime complexity as well. This I am choosing not to derive here out of respect for my time and the brevity of this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few notes here at the end on this paper. They used the metric Normalized Compression Distance as a stand-in for &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.3520.pdf">information distance&lt;/a> (or \(E(\cdot)\) which is uncomputable because of its dependence on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov complexity&lt;/a>. The idea is that as the compression ratio of gzip becomes higher, it will eventually approach \(K(\cdot)\), thus \(NCD\) approaches \(E\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next note I had here is a video on optimality and related to kolmogorov complexity (specifically on the algorithm proposed in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity#Uncomputability_of_Kolmogorov_complexity">uncomputability section&lt;/a> of that wikipedia article: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ONm1od1QZo">&amp;ldquo;The most powerful (and useless) algorithm&amp;rdquo; - polylog&lt;/a> and its percursor: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrKlPzceeqc">&amp;ldquo;The OPTIMAL algorithm for factoring!&amp;rdquo; - polylog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upcoming week of work</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2023-11-20-coursework-and-weekend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2023-11-20-coursework-and-weekend/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have a good amount of large projects for my coursework coming along, thus will unfortunately be pretty busy.

Current ongoing projects for my coursework are the advanced formal methods project on LTSA, the quality assurance project on the card game &amp;lsquo;Love Letter&amp;rsquo;, and wrapping up some personal projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some reason, ligatures are not supported on Emacs for the new font I was discussing in the last post &lt;a href="posts/2023-11-16-small-and-upcoming">JuliaMono&lt;/a>. I see that there are a few packages and setups that do have ligatures working (seems like nothing is out of the box for this feature) but none of them look super simple/appealing to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed an older movie last weekend that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good comedy and a progressive tone: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auntie_Mame_(film)">Auntie Mame&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am almost to the point where I &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to clean out/up and backup my old PC. Its being converted into a Steam Big picture mode-esque machine and I will need to move all of my files off of it onto another machine. Hopefully, with a bit of effort, collecting all of these documents/files together, organizing them, and properly backing them up (&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf">and up to the cloud&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

I have a few posts coming down the pipeline but the are a little big and I have some things that I want to share &lt;em>now&lt;/em>. For example, check out this cool font that I have been trying out for the past few days:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think it is easy to read and a bit more playful than my standard monospaced font for nearly everything in my life: RobotoMono Nerd Font Mono. Currently I am using this font in my emacs configuration as well as in my terminal emulator (kitty).&lt;/p>

I was busy then (surprise!), I am busy now. What changed? Priorities. The phrase &amp;ldquo;you have to &lt;em>make&lt;/em> time for it&amp;rdquo; was something that didn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with me for a number of years. When I first heard the phrase, it was probably in reference to some responsibilities that I had shirked on, thus the negative association. I have come around to truly appreciate the phrase for what it is and use it myself. If I don&amp;rsquo;t prioritize something, it will not happen. I will fill my time with other things first and whatever task it is will either be forgotten or discarded. I am not discarding a number of things, including this webpage. Eventually, using this page and others, I will organize and collate the important items in my life digitally. This will probably take a long time (probably a lifetime). For now here are a few projects of mine that I would like to showcase over the past few years particularly using the Rust programming language.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jack-champagne/rustlings">Rustlings Solutions Repository&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is my fork of the rustlings project with my solutions as patches applied on the trunk. I added a small bit of CI for Gitlab to ensure that my solutions complete the exercises correctly. I periodically update this by pulling the upstream changes into a staging branch, rebasing my changes onto that branch (fixing any conflicts that appear), making small tweaks to exercises that have been updated, getting CI to pass, then merging into the main branch. This means that I have quite a collection of my own solutions to a number of exercises that test knowledge on the basic components of the Rust programming language.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/jack-champagne/ferrous-broadcast">Ferrous broadcast&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This project is simply a TCP server that takes messages sent over the socket to the server and resends it to all connected sockets/clients. It is a fun way to spin up a really small chat room really quickly (assuming that you can telnet over your local network and type in all the right ip addresses :-)). I was going to turn this project into something with a small tui (text user interface) but UI is never really my game.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-champagne/cs377-final-project">CS377 Final Project - Demo file system&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This project was my final project for the intro to operating systems course at University of Massachusetts Amherst. This undergrad course allowed for a project type of your choosing - as long as it was an individual project. Most of this course was done in C and C++. I wanted to do a Rust rewrite of one of the projects, and after some debating on which project could remain as faithful to the original implementation, I decided the filesystems project was a good start. The implemented file system is extraordinarily limited, and a file is used as a proxy for an actual block device, but it does have some of the basic components of filesystems implemented (free block list, inodes, block pointers). It does not implement in its current state many essential features of modern filesystems such as directories, permissions, superblock(s), indirect blocks, journaling, etc. Finally, this project contains multiple layers: extensive documentation, unit/system testing, github ci/cd, and a few other tools. This implementation also attempts to remain on feature parity with the project itself. This cause me to learn about the #[repr(C)] macro in Rust which forces the underlying representation to match that of a C struct. Initially, I got the filesystem to work, but because the Rust representation of data and the C representation of data were no identical, the data written to the proxy block device was different between the two implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a few other small project written in Rust that aren&amp;rsquo;t worth sharing here - either because most of the code was derived from someone/somewhere else or because the project is so incomplete that it does not work/isn&amp;rsquo;t worth sharing. A good example of this is the two-part project that initial motivated me to learn the Rust programming language: C library of datastructures as presented in CS187, and a C library of algorithms as presented in CS311. These two projects are related to eachother in that I wanted to use the datastructures library in the implementation of the algorithms library. Both I chose to write in C for a few reasons: practice in C, manually managing memory, difficulty, performance. These two projects never came to full fruition, however the datastructures project did make some strides (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-champagne/libds">libds&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lost some interest in the project when I started dealing with the dependency injection required for custom types. Say you&amp;rsquo;re making a binary tree out of char[] types, how do you determine the strings ordinality? The answer is you can&amp;rsquo;t for every type, at least not within the library. A way to do this is let the user specify their own comparison function and inject that function to be used inside the implementation of the binary tree. This uses functions pointers, &amp;ldquo;void *&amp;rdquo; types, and feels a little like bending C to feel more object oriented, all things that were displeasing to me even though they were (maybe) necessary evils. The answer for me here&amp;hellip; a language that had a more comprehensive type system while still remaining low-level - thus Rust. Essentially, I wanted to be able to have the power of generics (like C++ templates really), without the horrors of C++. Eventually I will take those projects and resurrect them from the land of C and put them in Rust so that I may work past those barriers I ran into long ago, but for now I have much more pressing tasks to attend to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final word on Rust projects I have tried includes some very low level work trying to write something to make a disk image that boots via BIOS and then hangs, a dumb kernel if you will, to learn some of the necessary steps of booting to an operating system. I had a good name for this &amp;lsquo;ferrOS&amp;rsquo;, probably derived/inspired from &lt;a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems">ferrous-systems&lt;/a> and the work that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen by folks like &lt;a href="https://github.com/phil-opp">phil-opp&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/japaric">japaric&lt;/a>. For some time I was following the blog by &lt;em>phil-opp&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s the most complete list of Rust projects and information about them that I can gather for now.&lt;/p>

I got to experience and learn at lot at UMass and will be looking back on it with rose-colored glasses. I had the opportunity to continue my studies and do a masters degree at UMass in computer science. Due to a program offered by the university, and my desire to join industry quickly, I opted for their accelerated Master&amp;rsquo;s program. This required that I take graduate courses that were to be stripped from my undergraduate transcript and put onto my graduate transcript. Interestingly, most of the courses I ended up taking circa fall 2021 - spring 2023 were heavily skewed towards machine learning systems and data science but what I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up enjoying in industry is working with embedded systems and hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took a number of courses that were heavily focused in theory (Algorithms for data science, Indep. Study, Quantum Information Systems, Cryptography) and some more practice oriented courses (Machine Learning, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, a number of mathematics courses). In the end my piece of advice to students at University of Massachusetts Amherst, particularly those following a similar path to my own, would be to not focus on perfection in coursework. Spend time around your classmates - some of the most creative, intelligent, and passionate individuals I have ever met I first started talking to when they sat next to me in class. If you are feeling particularly inspired, the university is perhaps one of the only places where you can take the helm (so to speak) and dive into something of your own. This path may seem risk and challenging, but if you do it for long enough and well enough (and you&amp;rsquo;re lucky), you can become a researcher-&amp;gt;Ph.D.-&amp;gt;Post-Doc-&amp;gt;Professor and get funding to work on something truly of your own making, how incredible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A applied to a number of universities through the graduate application process, primarily focused on Master&amp;rsquo;s programs in computer science and was accepted to University of California Los Angeles, Carnegie Mellon University, and my undergraduate institution University of Massachusetts Amherst. While this decision was difficult, especially since leaving UMass meant a more expensive and unfamiliar program, I did decide to attend CMU for a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Software Engineering (focus in Embedded Systems). I have many people to thank for this process along the way which I will not list here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end of my undergraduate experience was particularly significant as it meant that my long time girlfriend and I would no longer have to be in a long-distance relationship. She, the incredible person she is, also decided that she would join me to Pittsburgh, something that I am grateful for. To kick off the summer, Lillian and I finally went on a road-trip that I had been planning for a few months across the United States. This is something that deserves its own post (or many!) to detail more about this trip. We traveled about across 25 U.S. states, over 10 national parks, a number of national monuments (I don&amp;rsquo;t have a detailed list of these, there were many), 15,000 miles of driving, about 28 days of van-lifing inside of a converted SUV. I highly recommend it for anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t tried: an impromptu trip with sufficient time set-aside but little to no constraints on where and when you can go (no reservations, appointments, etc). After this trip concluded, I spent a little time working in Burlington, VT at BETA technologies and then moved to Pittsburgh PA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CMU has kept me incredibly busy so far. I am impressed and still overwhelmed by the sheer scale of resources, opportunities, and information that I am exposed to but I try to be a sponge for it all. Currently I am considering a number of different courses to take next semester as an elective (something quantum, something systems like O.S., something machine learning, something computer networking) but I do not have the information I need yet to make that decision. A stale blog that lacks recent posts should be deleted, thus here I am. And hopefully will be.&lt;/p>

I finally put my website behind cloudflare (for a number of reasons) and configured everything earlier today to get it working again. The main sticking point for me was Github re-issuing an SSL certificate for the website after the DNS change. I also added an email address that forwards to my personal email with a jackchampagne.com extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason that I put the website behind cloudflare was because of their Yubikeys offer (10 for $10 each discounted price). I have always wanted a set of yubikeys but found them to be cost prohibitive.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since my family moved, I have not been home (due to school) long enough to set up my server again. Anyways a few things have happened. Last Tuesday I had an interview with BETA Technologies for the embedded systems team. The next day (Wed, 4/13/22) I got the offer! Super excited about that. Talked to Jason Wolfson at AirCycler today to let him know that I am not coming back and chatted about aircraft for a bit. I have stumbled across another video that I find extremely good and was inspired to make a curated list of some of the best youtube videos I have watched over the years. The videos will be loosely educational, hopefully leaving the watchers with a sense of satisifaction and having learned something new or seen something beautiful&lt;/p>

I love open-source because the code is auditable, security can be reviewed just by looking at the source, the software isn&amp;rsquo;t an opaque black box, and it creates a community around a piece of software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each one of these has side-effects that are, for the most part, beneficial to everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Privacy that is verifiable and trackable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security through bug reports and whatever patching process the project has&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The power of anyone being able to propose changes to ensure a piece of software is working as intended for whatever use case&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support through others on forums, community wikis, and project documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;Free&amp;rsquo; in free and open-source software does not primarily represent the price (although all free software does not cost money). The &amp;lsquo;Free&amp;rsquo; stands for &lt;em>free&lt;/em>dom. That is, the freedom to use, distribute, modify software as you please. This is a beautiful thing. There is no such thing as &amp;lsquo;sunsetting&amp;rsquo; a free and open-source software project, the community of those who use the software have the freedom to maintain it. You are protected from feature regression of features that you need. Paywalls for features shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a thing, and if a project is truly free and open-source, you can modify it and redistribute as you wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a sense, free and open-source software is like writing software where the code that gets put in is democratically accepted by a project community. If a project maintainer goes haywire and starts accepting questionably contributions and changes to their project, the community can make a fork. If the fork is truly better than the original, there is no reason why it can&amp;rsquo;t become the dominant and most widely-used version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like machines, tools, and ideas that &lt;strong>last forever&lt;/strong>. People buy lathes from the 1960s because they are reasonably accurate but will last forever. Free and open-source software are the &lt;em>software tools&lt;/em> that will last me forever. Because of that I am willing to put in the time now to find, learn, and configure said software for a lifetime of utility.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

I am deeply inspired by his skills and his constant focus on his work. comma.ai and his new streams about the cherry computer are deeply interesting to me and I find that his content in general relates very well with my studies in statistics, mathematics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and general computer science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started my REU (TRIPODS @ University of Massachusetts, Amherst) on Monday the 7th and since then have trained multiple models on my computer (actually my laptop because it has cuda cores). I am working on implementing a g-convolution into a new network to try and improve my preformance on a rotated and mirrored MNIST dataset.

&lt;h1 id="the-fibonnaci-numbers">The Fibonnaci Numbers&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There is a simple mathematical relationship that can be found intimately in many parts of nature and seemingly unrelated bits of math. This simple relationship and its emergent properties can be related to the geometry of pentagons, spirals in plants, and weather phenonmena like hurricanes. For the uninitiated, the Fibonnaci numbers are a set of numbers that are &lt;em>recusively defined&lt;/em> meaning that the next number in the sequence can be found using the previous numbers. I first stumbled upon this mathematical gem many years ago in a Youtube video (see below) by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart">Vihart&lt;/a>.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahXIMUkSXX0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this fibonnaci numbers, we use the following formula to find the next number in the sequence with the starting numbers \( F_0 = 0, \quad F_1 = 1 \).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing out the first few numbers, we have something like \( 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 23, \dots \) and so on. If theres one thing that mathematicians love, it is generalizations and closed forms. In its current state, finding the n-th fibonnaci number \( F_n \) requires us to calculate \( F_{n-1} \) which requires us to calculate \( F_{n-2} \) which requires us to&amp;hellip;. and so on. Finding the 100000th fibonnaci number sounds like something that will take forever. What if there was a better way? Using a little bit of linear algebra, we can show that there *is* a better way. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t too familiar with linear algebra, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about this part, it is just a derivation of a well known attribute of the fibonnaci sequence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we will do in this next part is do a matrix diagonalization. But not to worry! In essence, we will find a way to calculate the n-th fibonnaci number without having to calculate all the previous numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First let&amp;rsquo;s set up two equations we have and what we know is true.
\[ \begin{aligned}
F_{n+2} &amp;amp;= F_{n+1} + F_{n} \\&lt;br>
F_{n+1} &amp;amp;= F_{n+1}
\end{aligned} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a system of linear equations which we can simplify into a matrix.
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
F_{n+2}\\&lt;br>
F_{n+1}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; 1\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
F_{n+1}\\&lt;br>
F_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ \overrightarrow{F}_{n+1} =
\mathbf{A} \vec{F_{n}} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if we want to find the n-th fibonnaci number, and we know \( \vec{F_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\0 \end{bmatrix}\), we can apply our transformation matrix multiple times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ \begin{aligned}
\vec{F_1} &amp;amp;= \mathbf{A} \vec{F_0}\\&lt;br>
\vec{F_2} &amp;amp;= \mathbf{A} \vec{F_1} = \mathbf{A} (\mathbf{A} \vec{F_0}) = \mathbf{A}^2 \vec{F_0} \\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;\,\,\,\,\vdots \\&lt;br>
\vec{F_k} &amp;amp;= \mathbf{A}^k \vec{F_0}
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we are getting closer to a more direct way to computing fibonnaci. Unfortunately, taking higher and higher powers of a matrix is computationally the same problem as computing fibonnaci directly, the trick to approach finding higher powers of this matrix is what the &lt;strong>diagonalization&lt;/strong> will give us. Diagonalization leverages special attributes of matrices called eigenvalues and eigenvectors so that we can simplify this problem (and problems like it). If interested, read more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix">here on wikipedia&lt;/a>.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Here is how we will split up our matrix \(\mathbf{A} \):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{S} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{S}^{-1} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This factorization &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix#Application_to_matrix_functions">(which I will not go through in detail)&lt;/a> allows us to take higher powers of a matrix easily, as so&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[\mathbf{A}^k = (\mathbf{S} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{S}^{-1})^k = (\mathbf{S} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{S}^{-1})(\mathbf{S} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{S}^{-1}) \dots (\mathbf{S} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{S}^{-1}) = \mathbf{S} \mathbf{\Lambda}^k \mathbf{S}^{-1} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best part is, \( \Lambda \) is a &lt;em>diagonal matrix&lt;/em> which allows us to compute higher powers of it extremely easily, all we have to do is take higher powers of each of the elements to compute higher powers of the matrix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So continuing, we will find the diagonalization of matrix A and we will find from that, a closed-form equation that will give us the n-th fibonnaci number. Here begins our diagonlizations procedure. You can skip this if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like checking my work but its just finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for our matrix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First finding the eigenvalues. Essentially eigenvalues and eigenvectors give us a special vector that when multiplied by a matrix gives back simple multiple of the original vector. \(\mathbf{A}\vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x} \). For an random vector (not the zero vector) this is normally not the case. These vectors, and the factors they get multipled by, will give us the information we need to construct our diagonalization. We know that \(\mathbf{A}\vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x} \) and because of that \(\mathbf{A}\vec{x} - \lambda \vec{x} = \vec{0} \) and the following. \( \left( \mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right) \vec{x} = \vec{0}\). We can solve for the value of lambda by taking the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">determinant&lt;/a> and setting it equal to zero, as per the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[\begin{aligned}
\begin{vmatrix}
1 - \lambda &amp;amp; 1\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; -\lambda \\&lt;br>
\end{vmatrix} &amp;amp;= 0\\\\&lt;br>
\lambda^2 - \lambda - 1 &amp;amp;= 0
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we find the eigenvector for \(\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) by looking at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra)">nullspace/kernel&lt;/a> of \( \left( \mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right) \) which is basically all vectors \(\vec{x} \) that satisfy the following condition \( \left( \mathbf{A} - \lambda_1 \mathbf{I} \right) \vec{x} = \vec{0} \)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Nul}\left(\mathbf{A} - \tfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \mathbf{I}\right) &amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We translate back out from these equations \( x_1 = t \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \( x_2 = t \) to find a basis for the kernel (which will be an eigenvector). Setting \(t = 1\), we get the following \(\lambda_1: \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\). Which is an eigenvector that works for eigenvector/eigenvalue relationship defined in the beginning of this section. Now, we do the same thing for the other eigenvalue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now for \(\lambda_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
\[
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Nul}\left(\mathbf{A} - \tfrac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \mathbf{I}\right) &amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; -\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; -\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; -\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}\\&lt;br>
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, for \(\lambda_2: \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now we can construct our diagonalized factorization per the diagonalization procedure. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues go corresponding columns. If the first eigenvalue goes into the first column of \(\lambda\) then its eigenvector goes into the first column of \(\mathbf{S}\) and \(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[
\begin{aligned}
A^k &amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; 1\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0 \\&lt;br>
0 &amp;amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}^k
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; 1\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\\&lt;br>
\begin{bmatrix}
F_{k+1} \\&lt;br>
F_{k}
\end{bmatrix}
&amp;amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; 1\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; 0 \\&lt;br>
0 &amp;amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}^k
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} &amp;amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \\&lt;br>
1 &amp;amp; 1\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\&lt;br>
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally we arrive after some multiplication and taking a quick matrix inverse at the equation called the Binet formula. It is a relationship using the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio&lt;/a> that can give us the \(n\)th fibonnaci number. Since we only care about the bottom equation as it is the fibonnaci relation \(F_{k} \), we will focus on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ \begin{bmatrix}
F_{k+1}\\&lt;br>
F_{k}\\&lt;br>
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^{k+1} - \left ( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^{k+1}}{\sqrt{5}} \\&lt;br>
\frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k - \left ( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}}
\end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ F_k = \frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k - \left ( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an amazing thing! Being able to find the \(n\)th fibonnaci number without expensive recursive addition with some exponentiation, addition, and division. The main topic of this blog post is not actually on this equation though, it is more about the following generalization. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have never thought about the 4.5th fibonnaci number, but now you see it might be calculable! We can plug any number into the exponent of the Binet equation. Naturally, I grab a calculator, type in the equation and I am disappointed when it spits back out error. It became quickly apparent why it did so. The second half of the equation \( \left ( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k \) becomes problematic without careful analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Observe that the base of this exponentiation is negative! (\(\approx -0.6 \)), the issue is when we try to raise a negative number to a fractional power, we can end up in a situation like this&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ (-0.6)^{4.5} = (-0.6)^{\frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{-(0.6)^9} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And uh oh, we&amp;rsquo;re in the complex plane. But this is still an answer, and here we have come to a stunning realization, fractional fibonnaci numbers are complex! This next part is some personal work exploring this and a few fun graphs. Before I go into my own analysis, I&amp;rsquo;d like to mention the inspiration for this post, Matt Parker and his youtube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths">(Stand Up Maths)&lt;/a> posted a video called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghxQA3vvhsk">Complex Fibonacci Numbers?&lt;/a> in June 2020 which inspired me to make this blog post.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> A lot of the ideas are borrowed from that video.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s graph it! But first, we need to figure out how we want to graph this function. A common approach it to use the x-axis for the real-valued part of the function and use the y-axis for the imaginary-valued part of the function. To find these components, I am using a little manipulation that looks like the following&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[
Re((-b)^{x}) = |-b|^{x} cos(x \pi))
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Imaginary component, same thing except we use sine. And now, we decompose into components&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Re}\left( \frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k - \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} \right) &amp;amp;= \frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} - \text{Re}\left( \frac{\left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} \right )\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} - \frac{\left | \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right |^k cos(k \pi )}{\sqrt{5}} \\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k - \left | \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right |^k cos(k \pi )}{\sqrt{5}}
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now the imaginary part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Img}\left( \frac{\left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k + \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} \right) &amp;amp;= \text{Img}\left( \frac{\left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^k}{\sqrt{5}} \right )\\&lt;br>
&amp;amp;= \frac{\left | \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right |^k sin(k \pi )}{\sqrt{5}}\\&lt;br>
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sweet! Let&amp;rsquo;s first look at the graph of the real component of this function. Let the x-axis in this graph be \(k\) or the index of the Fibonnaci number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/x526ua96f3?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now for the complex component of this function. Again, let the x-axis be \(k\) or the index of the Fibonnaci number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gflxigver1?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we graph both of them at the same time. We do this but defining a paramteric function where the parameter is \(k\) or the index of the fibonnaci number. Note that the axes now mean different things. The x-axis is the real component of the k-th fibonnaci number and the y-axis is the imaginary component of the k-th fibonnaci number. \(k \) varies from -20 to 20 and the green dot is \(k-th \) fibonnaci number and it varies from \(k = -1.5\) and \(k = 4\). And here&amp;rsquo;s the final graph in all of its glory!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0xdpor9rhl?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note how the zero-th fibonnaci number is at (0,0) and how this function passes through the point (1,0) twice! (three times if you include the negative first fibonnaci number!). The fibonnaci numbers spiral outwards when we look at negative fibonacci numbers, the \(-1\)st fibonacci number is \(1\) for example. The spiral looks like this zoomed out&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/npxv17zrye?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to play around with my graphs &lt;a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k1ucihepaz">here&lt;/a>, they are quite interesting to animate. You can also see some of the other details about fibonnaci and this particular thing in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another analysis that I wanted do to immediately after I saw Matt Parker&amp;rsquo;s video was looking at other recursively defined number sets. For one, there are the lucas numbers, where it is the same rule as the fibonnaci relation but the starting values are \(2, 1\) respectively. So the sequence goes \(2, 1, 3, 4, 7, \dots \).
Here is a graph of that spiral!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pwelsrbr20?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coolest part in my opinion is what happens when we let the initial parameters change and see the resulting graph, here is a graph that animates the changing initial conditions for the recurrence relation and the changing curve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align:center">&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b1hjwvrtug?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the next considerations that I could make and explore include what happens to this curve when we change the recurrance relation and add coefficients to the equation like this
\[F_{n+2} = c_1 F_{n+1} + c_2 F_{n} \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does this change the eigenvalues and eigenvectors? What if we change the initial conditions for this new relationship? These are all interesting explorations that can be done but for now, I leave this for something to appreciate and possibly explore yourself. Here is the &lt;a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cycgxam5ec">link&lt;/a> to the second graph if you want to explore that one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This page is an exploration of MathJax LaTeX rendering and adding various iframes (desmos) across a complex page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intro-to-functions">Intro to functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ok so for the first exploration of this page, I thought it would be excellent to discuss some basic math. My goal for this page is to be able to read it from bottom to top and for nearly everyone with a basic high-school level of math to be able to understand &lt;em>visually&lt;/em> some important aspects of math.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets start with some aspects of math that we will build on in the future.
Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine we live in a world where the cost of goods will grow over time at a set rate, say $1 per day (I know, crazy, but math is the only subject that allows for such imaginary realities to exist). I am trying to buy a box of cereal and its cost is currently $5. If I come back tomorrow, it will be $6 and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we wanted to find the price of the box next week, we would count the number of days and add it to original price. What if we want to find the price of the box any amount of days from now? Then we can just do this right?
\[ price = $1 * number\,o\!f\,days + $5 \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what is called a function. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the term function before in a math class or in a programming class and, fortunately, both have similar aspects to them. In essence a function is something, &lt;em>anything&lt;/em>, that takes some information (or things) as input(s) and produces some sort of output(s). For this specific function, we are trying to calculate the price on a given day in the future &lt;em>given&lt;/em> how many days from now into the future. In other words, our function&amp;rsquo;s output is the price and its input(s) is how many days into the future. Here is a graph of some days into the future (horizontally) and their respective prices using our equation (vertically)&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/uwhcmfoyop?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>Look at the straight line that the function follows!&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nfbkour6gb?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>As with a lot of things, there are multple ways we can describe this function. Here are a few below (\(p = price\), \(n = number\,o\!f\,days\)):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[p = 1*n + 5\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since \(1*n = n\,&amp;hellip;\)
\[p = n + 5\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And using the basic principles of functions, we know that every function will have inputs and outputs. It might be useful to denote this by listing out all of the inputs a function can take and the output. Since \(p\) is an output and \(n\) is an input, we will denote the function of price based on input number of days as \(p(n)\). And so it follows
\[p(n) = n + 5\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The parenthesis will alway enclose the inputs to the function and the letter (or group of symbols) out in the front will always denote a common way of referring to the output For instance, both are commonplace. Let \(n = 2\):
\[p(2) = 1*2 + 5 = 7\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[p = 1*2 + 5 = 7\]&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="multi-input-functions">Multi-input functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="referred-to-as-multivariate-functions-more-on-that-later">Referred to as multivariate functions (more on that later)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Functions are awesome! And very versatile, if we want to define a new function that takes in say&amp;hellip; the number of boxes of cereal you want to purchase, number of days in the future, and want the output to be total price, we could do something like this (let \(b = \) number of boxes of cereal to purchase and \(t = \) total price), \(p(n, b) =\) something! (We could actually do it out and get the following if we wanted to)
\[t(n, b) = b*(n + 5)\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice how the price for a single box is on the inside of the parenthesis? We have already defined a function that describes the price of a single box (given input \(n\)) so why don&amp;rsquo;t we try using it here?
\[t(n, b) = b*p(n)\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looks like that works! Also not only that, we stumble upon an important concept for function notation. The importance of input variables. Notice how if we set \(n = 5\) and \(b = 3\) we get this:
\[t(5, 3) = 3*p(5)\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice how when I change the value of \(n\), the other \(n\) on the right hand side of the equal sign changes to that same value. Also notice the same thing for \(b\). These inputs are specific and independent, when I change the value of one, only the corresponding same symbols denoting that input change and not anything else in our equation. This consistency is important because it also means that when we define a function, the order of the inputs does not matter, as long as our symbols denoting inputs are consistent.
\[t(n, b) = b*(n + 5)\]
Is the exact same thing as
\[t(b, n) = b*(n + 5)\]
However, if you set one of these inputs to a value, notice how we must maintain that consistency (let \(n = 5\) and \(b = 2\)). If \(t\) is defined as \(t(n, b)\), then to get the correct total we must do \(t(5, 2)\). If \(t\) is defined as \(t(b, n)\) then doing \(t(5, 2)\) would be wrong, and doing \(t(2, 5)\) would be correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key point, &lt;strong>always match symbols (and values) carefully&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="more-functions">More functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="multivariate-functions">Multivariate functions&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Input can often be treated as variables, or symbols that represent a quantity/can change/and other things. The function we started off with as \(p(n)\) was a single variable function, hence, single-variate function. The function we came up with \(t(n, b)\) had multiple variables, hence, it can be called a multivariate function. More specifically, since it has only 2, it can also be called a &lt;em>bivariate&lt;/em> function. (Note: Since a bivariate function has more than one variable, is also a multivariate function)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="non-linear-functions">Non-linear functions&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>So far we have only dealt with linear functions (yes \(t(n, b)\) was also a linear function, more on that later). Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at other functions. If we have a square with side length \(s\), then the area of that square will be given as \(s*s\). We can define this as a function \(A\) which gives area for a square with side length \(s\):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[A(s) = s*s\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be simplified as we know that \(s*s = s^2\) .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[A(s) = s^2\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now lets try a couple of values for s. \(A(1) = 1,\, A(2) = 2*2 = 4,\, A(3) = 9,\, A(4) = 16,\, \dots\) And then graph some of those values.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/oeyanj7k1h?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>With a linear function, the function follows a nice straight line (hence the name) for inputs, this function cannot be linear however because no straight line exists that the graph will follow. Look! The &lt;em>only&lt;/em> straight line that exists that goes through the first two points does not go through any of the other points, therefore there cannot be a straight line that the graph follows!&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/romi46uwti?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>This is out first non-linear function, and there are many different non-linear functions. The colored lines in the graph below are each their own different class of non-linear function.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/87uk5fwxpt?embed" width="500px" height="500px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>Lots of variety, and there&amp;rsquo;s more! But we will get to that later.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This is a \( Test \) of mathjax and \( \LaTeX \).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Been doing some fun things with more markup languages this semester and have really enjoyed contining to learn \( \LaTeX \) check this out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ e^{a + bi} = cos(a) + i cos(b) \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And how about this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ \oint_{\gamma} F dS \]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you enjoy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This past week</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-26-youtube-continued/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-26-youtube-continued/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am going to be honest, last week was such a blur. On monday, I got home after a weekend with my mom and now its already Saturday afternoon. A lot of this has to do with how I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending my time, the workload at the end of the week due to exams, and also taking care of my family&amp;rsquo;s puppy Ivy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have two ideas of things that I want to do programming wise:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Continue working on the youtube bot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a minecraft package manager (??)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I would love to keep my minecraft configurations up to date effortlessly. Litematica is very cool and useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I should write here today but I am sure I will have more stuff to write about after this weekend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Canning tomatoes</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-21-canning-tomatoes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-21-canning-tomatoes/</guid><description>&lt;p>And we are back in Duxbury! After finishing up classes this morning, Lillian and I headed back to Duxbury to take Ivy to her first vet visit (Today!). Hailey and my father stayed home today and they instead took her which took some time pressure off of me. Once I got home, me and Lillian sat down on the couch and promptly took a 20 minute power nap (a really good one too might I add!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend was fantastic, lots of activities, canning, good food, and tons of laughs. Lillian and I left on Friday (9/18) at around 3ish so that we could make it in time for dinner to my moms. We made an italian style dinner with spaghetti and used the bread from brothers for olive oil dipping goodness. The meatballs in the tomato sauce were perfectly cooked and balanced everything out quite well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following day, we had a slow morning followed by a busy afternoon of going to farm stands to get ingredients (corn, tomatoes, and such) for tomorrow. We got back up to the lake and took the four wheeler out for a bit (which is in great shape!)&amp;hellip; the dirt bike unfortunately did not want to start. We went to Norte, a mexican style restaurant in Stephentown, NY and the food was extremely delicious. Next time I go, I know I can fall back on a chicken chimichanga, the tortilla outside was perfection. We socialized with Mark Prescott, Ben, and Martha towards the end of our evening there and headed back to the camp where I gave Lillian a grueling Calc II lesson on integration, derivatives, and the definition of an integral (which she understood quite well). Zonk&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Sunday, we woke up, had some breakfast and starting doing homework almost right away. It was a busy day and also I got to see for the first time how much more homework Lillian had this semester over me (1st semester was equal, 2nd semester was busy for me, this one was busy for her). We then drove up the mountain to Dyken pond to do some chores, canning and also making of horseradish. Ron showed Mark, Ben, Me, my mom, Chris, and Lillian how to make horseradish from the roots. My mom gave me a brief walkthrough reminding me the steps of tomato canning.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Sanitize the cans (don&amp;rsquo;t want to get botulism)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Score the skin of the tomatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boil for 30 seconds for skin to peel back&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core and remove all skin&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut into eights or sizable pieces and put into mason jars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put 1 tbsp of salt with the tomatoes in the mason jar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Properly seal lids finger tight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place jars into warm water and bring to boil. Once boiling, let boil for 25 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let cool slowly to avoid cracking and check seals.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It is very messy but that is what makes it fun. Lillian and I had homework to do so we went back down the hill to get the rest of her math quiz done. I had taught her a lot of concepts and heplful things to know when she is doing integration. She really hooked on to the integration with e^x in the integrand which was cool to see. Then from there, she really understood what u substitution was doing (reverse chain rule). Doing reverse product rule (integration by parts) was a little more difficult as getting across the theory is hard to do intuitively for me. I gave her the mnemonic LIATE which really helped and lots of reminders about u = and dv = integrations. Always always always don&amp;rsquo;t forget your dx&amp;rsquo;s! The integral is equal to 0 without them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a prime beef roast which was yummy and later that night we also made a delicious batch of pretzels. Incredibly, I was able to figure out how to do a four way braid without ever doing one before, and putting it into a pretzel form! Nice and salty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After getting the coffee jitters out before bed, I slept almost completely uninterrupted in the cold until my 8am bio class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Five guys was the play on the drive home,
Bye bye for now!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An anniversary</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-18-an-anniversary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-18-an-anniversary/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the couch with Lillian.

For this version, I plan on adding a few useful features and changing the underlying workings and dependencies. Here are some ideas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make dependencies lightweight by looking at dependency source code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove shelve and replace by json file reading and writing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Feature additions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Download playlist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Single video downloader&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Possible additions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Channel name search?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Continuous integration?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For one, I don&amp;rsquo;t think shelve is necessary for saving simple strings of urls. The multithreading is very nice in the previous version and I am very proud of it. I would like to organize this by making issues and refactoring the code so that it is more readable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boston Visit</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-15-boston-visit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-15-boston-visit/</guid><description>&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen my mom since Dyken Pond with my friends and it has been too long! My mom invited me and Lillian to say in Boston two night ago for the night of the 14th. We drove into the city and had dinner at Artu in the north end. The fettucini alfredo had an awesome spicy kick to it and my tagliatelle with proscuitto was nice and heavy. Just what I wanted. The burratta and country bread was delicious and I enjoyed eating there. The hotel was quite nice and since me and Lillian finished Scooby Doo Mystery incorporated this past Sunday (9/13/2020), we did a few crosswords and played Among Us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mystery Incorporated was an excellent show. The overarching plot alongside the classic scooby-doo mystery solving formula is very entertaining and gives something for everyone to enjoy. There were many twists and turns and lots of clever plot points and the character development and stories were interesting. I did enjoy this show and it was a solid 10/10 would watch again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I have started to teach Ivy to lay down. She is doing well and has a very consistent sit and we are working on her come and heel. I am very proud of her, even though she still bites a lot!, she is understanding more and more everyday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tootles lmao&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Site Update 1</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-15-site-update-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-15-site-update-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been thinking what I want to do with my online presence recently. The idea of create passive income sources has inspired me to create a bit of a business for myself online. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what I would do yet and have not found the time or headspace but I do think it is coming. I think this blog will be pushed to either a subdomain or under /blog/ or something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a couple of ideas right now of things that I have always wanted to create or do. I love the intersection between technology, math, and computer science but I find the space is quite saturated with channels and information. There is not a ton of channels that combine easy surface level explanations of concepts with many following videos. I would love to create something that is very me and highly accessible to anyone looking to make or do something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably will elaborate on this later or will be creating links to examples/products of mine to explain what I am talking about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gary</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-09-text-fun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-09-09-text-fun/</guid><description>&lt;p>───▄▄▄&lt;br>

They jump on the powerlines and accelerate the wear and tear of these utilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also! Another fun fact: Fall is the most dangerous and delay-prone season for riding trains! This is because leaves on train tracks lead to a braking hazard if the trains need to slow down. This is very similar to what its like on the roads when there is heavy rain, cautious drivers!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some minor updates &amp;ndash; The firefox extension did not make it easy to implement the features I wanted so I transferred my focus to another cause, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-champagne/youtube-downloader">youtube-dowloader&lt;/a>. Someone else also decided to look at the issues I had created for new features to be implemented and decided to make a PR on my repo, this was so cool! I love seeing this kind of collaboration. During the next week, I started spending lots of time towards working hard, finishing the novel that I was working on Pierce Brown&amp;rsquo;s Golden Son (part of the Red Rising series). It was excellent, I am deeply impressed by the character development and the mind-bending twists and turns the plot makes. More on this book to come in its own dedicated post.
I did well on my school assignments for the week but found myself feeling a little behind in 551 Scientific comp. so I attented office hours. I started planning for the weekend of Cody Champagne&amp;rsquo;s wedding towards the end of the week and got myself packed late thursday night (9/3/2020). We left early next morning with my grandmother who had arriced the day before (5:15am) for the airport to fly down to Birmingham, AL. We had a connection in Charlotte NC and then after a 1 1/2 hour drive out of Birmingham, we arrived at our destination, Clanton AL, Mitchell Lake. This was the location of the house for us to stay at (Near Walnut Creek). It was very beautiful and I even saw a Bald Eagle. After festivities friday night, a wedding ceremony and party the following night (9/5/2020) we went home early Sunday morning beginning my quarantine. Being around many people, even though I sported a mask and kept my distance, I believe it is better to be safe than sorry. I will be waiting with just the immediate family members that went down with me (Dad and grandma) until I get a negative test result or until it has been 14 days. I will not be in close contact with anyone and will be wearing a mask at all times in public.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday when we got home, we got to see Ivy for the first time. Ivy is the name of our brand new puppy (Silver Lab). She is 8 weeks old and is the most precious thing in the whole wide world. She is extremely docile, well-mannered, and has a great temperment. She takes lots of naps and loves to play tug of war. I love her and am looking forward to spending these first few days back home, while I am missing my girlfriend, distracting myself with the dog. Ivy comes from the color of her eyes and Hailey was inspired when a Frank Ocean song came on when she had picked her up much earlier on Sunday morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today (9/7/2020) we all got a test from ConvenientMD in Pembroke MA. I was very productive this past weekend and also today and want to continue this trend. The youtube downloader has helped tremendously by completely separating me from the time-engagement focused youtube algorithm. Things have been well! The dog is great and I am really proud of her and I think we got a really great, calm, easy to train puppy that will be a loving family member for years and years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update - Negative test recieved yesterday at 3pm (~26 hours after I had gotten tested). What a turn around time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See ya!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A New Start</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-08-26-a-new-start-and-a-new-plan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-08-26-a-new-start-and-a-new-plan/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s over. I have decided the youtube does not contribute anything tangible (in the way I use it) to my life. I am fed up and frustrated by how dangerous and how easily I fall into its trap and I am done with it. This morning, I woke up late for class because I should have went to bed earlier. It is nothing but a time waster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is my plan. I need to start valuing my time more. I am going to put my current hourly value at minimum wage ($12.75/hr). Every hour wasted per day on youtube (and other time wasting excessive behaviours) I must transfer those funds to my Titan holdings and the money will not be able to be spent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To help enforce this, I am going to start try and write a firefox extension that can track my youtube usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may be the start of something new, something better, and possibly a lot less spending money. Hopefully I can hold myself to it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Books, School, and Getting Lost</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-08-24-books-school-and-getting-lost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-08-24-books-school-and-getting-lost/</guid><description>&lt;p>What is new in my life? A lot of things actually. For starters, today is the first day of my sophomore year at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. It was a rather uncerimonious start as there was no move-in day, no meeting up with friends, no going to the dining hall, and no walking around the campus that I desperately miss. Instead, I woke up to my 7:45 alarm this morning, stayed in bed for 3 minutes and then got up and did my morning routine. Once ready, I popped on the 8am zoom call for my B.S. general education requirement, BIO 151. The professor seemed nice and for the first time, I saw a lot of students turn on their cameras on the zoom calls. I joined in this too hoping that it would increase my attention for the class and my retention of information. I am very comfortable with biology and do not find it hard to grasp and absorb which makes me hopeful fo this class. Right after, I hopped on to another zoom call for my Scientific Computing class. Both classes were moderately interesting and will definitely have something to offer. After a bout of laziness and youtube (my youtube python bot was written last week on Thursday! But it is broken) I headed into work at AirCycler to continue programming Bubbles Upcoming, I will be getting a puppy in all of six days from now and I am very anxious/excited for it. I look forward to it as a transformitive and learning expirience that will bring me a best friend, &amp;lsquo;a man&amp;rsquo;s best friend.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday (8/23/2020), me and Lillian decided to leave early in the morning to head out to Captains Flats. We saw lots of wildlife: moon snails, hermit crabs (a huge one too), birds, horse-shoe crabs, crabs, dead sand dollars, and even living sand dollars (first time seeing those!). The morning fog had still not lifted and we found ourselves far away from shore and withough any visual references to where land could be. We left our phones on shore as to not get them ruined by the salt water and the sun was far overhead making it difficult to discern the cardinal directions. The only thing that guided us back to shore before the tide went too far out was Lillian&amp;rsquo;s Apple Watch, which she had downloaded a compass app onto days before. We started heading west and eventually we ran into a guy and his dog who was able to point us in the right direction. He was standing quite close to shore but it was completely impossible to see through the fog. This was a lot of fun because it was a small &amp;lsquo;survival-like&amp;rsquo; scenario but was not dangerous at all. We made it all the way to shore (Thanks Dave and Bodie) and even kept most of our dead sand dollars intact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week for me was a bit of a blur but a couple of cool things happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Lillian, Hailey, Katie, and I helped make a cake for Lisa Savage&amp;rsquo;s birthday (It was better tasting than expected)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lisa and a little bit of her family came over to my house to celebrate her birthday.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I got a small course in how to cook a ribeye steak (bone-in) correctly on the grill. I was so delicious&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lillian got her apple watch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I heard from all of my classes and started organizing my &amp;lsquo;education-mode&amp;rsquo; self to excel this semester.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Today I have also been exploring Mini-PCs, NUCs, and SBCs looking for a solution to my small but powerful and cheap server wanting problem. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to have it look perfect do I? I might need to actually start allocating some discresionary income.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday evening, after preparing for school and such, I finally got around to finishing &amp;lsquo;Red Rising&amp;rsquo; by Pierce Brown and boy, oh, boy, that was one good book. It truly kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. So many twists and turns, artfully crafted sentences, rich and deep characters, intertwined destinies, all so great. I loved every moment of it and ordered the next book to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now!
Been feeling inspired by a couple of people around me (Russotiro, NODE, and others) to write my own theme for hugo, or just style my own webpage using html, css, and a little javascript. I love the look and simplicity of &lt;a href="https://n-o-d-e.net/">nodes webpage&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resume</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/cv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/cv/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="resume">Resume&lt;/h1>

A lot happened over the weekend and we got to do a lot of the things that I wanted to do. Firstly, the dates. Lillian and I left on Friday at around 1:30 - 2 and arrived at 5ish. Dinner had already been prepped by the both of us a week in advance so all we had to do was put on the spaghetti in advance, dress the chicken parm, and make a salad. The first day we swam and went out on the boat a bit to look at the stars. The sky was spectacular and we saw many shooting stars. I was able to identify (Saturn/Jupiter), Mars, Ursa Major, Polaris, Arcturus, and the Milky Way in the sky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day was a lot of water sports and good eating. We were all sore by the end of the day and we played a lot of BANG! the card game. I am going to reread the rules because after about 5 mins of reading them while writing this, I can tell that there have been a few fatal differences between how we play and how this game is supposed to be played. My mom also showed me how I can fix the boat when it is being afflicted with the bad gas from Stewarts (water in the gas) and we got the boat running for the whole weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sunday (8/16/2020) was a bit of a crazy day. Around lunch my mother got a call from Shane that Alannah was not doing well. I could tell by the questions she was asking that it was quite serious. My mother remained calm for the majority of the day and came and went as she was tending to the situation. Lillian cut my hair for the second time that afternoon. During dinner my mom had to leave and we said goodbye, Alannah passed away that night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sunday and Monday morning were relatively normal. I kept in contact with my mother (who had flew out to Atlanta on Monday morning) as well as continued to host my friends until we started cleaning up around 4. Lillian and everyone was a huge help because earlier I had sliced my big toe on a glass that fell after I cleaned it. I then hobbled over to the bathroom and for the second year in a row (this time because I was hopping around on one foot) I smashed the light fixture in the Dyken pond bathroom. My hand had minor cuts but my foot had a small but moderately deep cut that I had to dress with cotton balls, gauze, and waterproof tape. Everyone left the camp, sad to go, at around 4:40. There are still some things that I want to do up there with them that we did not get around to. I would like to bring everyone over to the environmental center for a hike out to the petrified bog. I would also like to bring everyone to ramblewild or something like that. I would also have liked to show all of my friends my mom&amp;rsquo;s house down in center Berlin and her back yard. I would also have liked to have enough time to show everyone the pet Emu&amp;rsquo;s that the people on Airport Rd. had. This will have to wait till next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is now Tuesday morning and I have just arrived at work at around 10:10, ready to use my brain, ready to work hard even with this slashed big toe. I am still working on Red Rising, Rust programming language, and am now prepping for the fall semester. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear back from any of the scholarships I applied for and my financial aid is unfortunately going to have to change for the fall semester. I have a lot of stuff to do to prep for the fast approaching fall semester and I am anxious to get learning again. This weekend I also have become more comfortable with the idea of not being able to have a normal spring semester. After hearing some &lt;em>very&lt;/em> preliminary data on campus life during the pandemic, I deem it unlikely that campus life will be back to normal in any meaningful way, even with a vaccine, during the spring. This is okay with me because I will get to have more continuous time with the new puppy which we will be getting on (8/29/2020) and also I will get to pay less money for not living in a dorm room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All for now, updates will keep rolling in as I go. A lot of motivation to work on the youtube bot though!!
Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see where that project will go.

&lt;p>Quick summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Been working hard at AirCycler solving problems and writing software.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On Aug 6th the chancellor annouced no on-campus housing for fully-remote students (doesn&amp;rsquo;t change my plans)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The upcoming puppy has been very exciting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lillian and I left Thursday, Jul 30th to head up to Dyken Pond&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lillian and I watched Hamilton the musical finally.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My mother, Lillian, and I visited mount Equinox during the week and took a hike&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lillian stayed until Aug 7th and I stayed the weekend with my ski friends (Ryan, Matt, Bobby, Sam, Reed) and my sister.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I came back and applied rule #76 to my life (Thanks Reed) =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Always play like a champion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started reading the book my friend Chris Gomez recommended me called &amp;ldquo;Red Rising&amp;rdquo;. So far, it is a great sci-fi novel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started learning rust Aug 13th. &lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-champagne/hello-rust">See hello-rust&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am leaving for dyken pond again tomorrow (Aug 14th) after Lillian finishes work to spend time with my Duxbury friends.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s basically the rundown! I have been &lt;em>very&lt;/em> unmotivated to work on this website because the DNS (on Github pages end) keeps breaking and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep fixing it. This night, 12:18 am on Aug 14th I finally re-read Github pages documentation which gives a good rundown on the DNS setup. It also seems like there have been lots of improvments to github pages recently too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been slowly beating back the bad habits monster but I am definitely feeling best this week out of the weeks I have been working (been trying to go into the office 9to5).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, I will hopefully be updating this while I am at Dyken Pond.
Bye!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Visit from Grandma</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-07-25-visit-from-grandma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-07-25-visit-from-grandma/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I took a day off from work and just relaxed for most of the morning by myself. My dad was coming home early from work and my grandmother was arriving later that day. Unfortunately during this, I was not disciplined in following my youtube restrictions and have slipped into a cycle of regression instead of progression. But alas, this morning (after a night of staying up far too late watching videos), I am remaking the commitment that I have made months before. A commitment to improvement and one to limiting how I interact with youtube as a platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, my Aunt Kim and Uncle Peter are coming and I expect a lot of family discussion about Cody&amp;rsquo;s wedding in the fall. It is still very up in the air as travelling and doing a family gathering like a wedding at this time is quite impractical and discouraged. Yesterday I also started another little project of mine. The minecraft mapping project. During the week, I found a great piece of software that takes in a minecraft world and creates a scrollable map of the entire world &lt;a href="https://overviewer.org">https://overviewer.org&lt;/a>. My friends and I have played many multiplayer worlds together over the years and I think a fun way of archiving them would be to have an overview of them online to explore. Unfortunately, this will not be version-controlled through github and implemented directly on github pages because of the enormous size of the file structure and render files themselves (Their system is a bit inefficient storage-wise imo but it is probably to have good LOD layers and high preformance when zoomed far out). So another solution is due, probably something like a dedicated piece of hardware?? Who knows?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways&amp;hellip; Seeya!
Jack&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dyken Pond</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-07-23-dyken-pond-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-07-23-dyken-pond-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>So it has been a while, and there are lots of reasons for this that I would like to discuss. First, I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss a timeline of everything that has happened in my life within the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On July 3rd, me and Lillian headed up to Dyken pond for a little bit of a vacation and to hang out with my mom. We arrived midday on the 3rd and we socially distanced ourselves from most people there (namely my sisters 6 friends that were up (Jul. 2 - 7th)). We spent a lot of time on the water, swimming, waterskiing, relaxing in center Berlin and doing porch coffee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 4th of July this year was spectacular, as it got darker, and the camp rowdiness was at peak, me and Lillian went for a paddle on a one person kayak out to the middle of the lake to enjoy the fireworks. It was quite trecherous because of 2 people being in one seat in a small kayak as well as for other unnamed reasons but once we got out to the middle of the lake, we got an awesome show. The brown house by the dam (or near there) did a fireworks show that lasted 13 minutes and probably costed upwards of one thousand dollars. After an awesome finale, and somehow without tipping and taking on water, we slowly made our way to shore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we got back, I helped Peggy Carter set up her tent that she had brought and the the cot for inside. An accident down by the dam happened that night. A 91 year old man had an accident by the dam after hitting the ditch on the side of the road and having a heart attack that prompted a ambulance, police department (maybe also fire dept.) response, so the sky went quiet. This added a little bit of chaos to the night but by the time we went to bed around 12ish, all was quiet. Early next morning, there was a lunar eclipse at around 5:30am, I was fast asleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next couple of days consisted mainly of me and Lillian enjoying being away from the hustle bustle of Duxbury. She finally understood what I meant by the feel of Berlin and how I liked it better, away from all the white suburbia and &amp;lsquo;Karens&amp;rsquo;. It is refreshing being out there and it is something that I sincerely enjoy. I spend a good amount of time that week creating a better system for the rope swing. Cooking and helping prepare for our camping weekend. Helping out with various chores around the house. After Hailey and her friends left, me and Lillian headed up to sleep at the Dyke rather than the guest room in Center Berlin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Towards the end of that next week, my mom, Lillian, and I went on a camping trip up to Lake Placid to explore the Adirondacks a bit. On the way, we stopped at Ft. Ticonderoga and got to see many beatiful vistas and looming mountains. When we arrived to the campground, I realized that I kind of forgot what camping at a campsite was like. They had all the amenities and we parked our car in our site. We settled in for the day after having a bite to eat from the Dack Shack and unpacked all of our things and set up our tent. I am more of a purist when it comes to camping. I like living off of granola and insta-cook meals on a portable camping stove. Wearing backpacks in and not having any power/cell service. The &amp;lsquo;glamping&amp;rsquo; was nice but not what I picture in my head for sure when I thing about camping. The next day we woke up and started heading to Mount Jo for a nice hike with great views. Whiteface would be too difficult of a hike for us to jump into easily and would be strenuous. Mount Jo was the right size and at the top we got a great view of Mt. Algonquin and Mt. Marcy in the distance with the Adirondack Loj below (great history there, worlds largest log cabin before a fire in ~1903.) We headed back down the mountain so that we could find a good spot for my mom to get cell service as it was a friday and she had a conference call to attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We drove back towards Lake Placid and took a quick pit stop look at the Olympic ski jumping complex on our way. It was closed unfortunately, so we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get up and personal with it but it was still massive from the parking lot. We headed back to town for the day to let my mom catch up on work and just walked around the campsite and nearby public swimming area. By now it was dinnertime and we had a camping classic, grilled chicken and rice with tobasco sauce, my favorite. Me and Lillian did most of the cooking and it came out pretty good, nothing burnt and the rice cooked just right. As it came closer to night and after dinner, we all had some of the banana bread Lillian and I had made 2 days before and played some Yahtzee!. We cleaned up site for the night to leave tomorrow morning and were fast asleep by 10:30pm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We left the next morning at about 8am and zipped on out of there. It had rained the night before but we had packed everything already which made the morning much easier. I drove us on the way back and we passed by some beautiful spots. One spot had a large waterfall that was viewable from the road and was very pretty. When we got back to Dyken Pond. It was a Saturday afternoon and we were leaving the following monday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sunday - After a great weekend we did a little bit of work on the front step to get it more stable and safe before we left the next day. Me and Lillian enjoyed a relaxing night next to another one of my fires (which I got roaring every night I made one, the coals would last until the morning).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On monday, we left after lunch ~4ish so that we could enjoy route 2 all the way home. I was a great drive with some funny moments closer to home, especially when we tried stopping in Lexington. It was back to the grind though when we got back, I wanted to get to work and get back to the office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the personal development part of this story comes in. I temporarily lift the youtube ban from the 13th till today. I watched many creators and videos and honestly do not want to know how much time I spent on the platform. This behaviour of bingeing after I had missed out on over a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of content was not what I should have been doing, hence why I am reinstating the ban. Youtube, and its ability to easily eat up my free time and boredom quickly impacted my work, sleep, and even this journal of mine in ways that I dislike deeply. I am making a commitment to myself that for me to continue using that platform as it contains many creators that I am interested by, love, and enjoy, I have decided that I must program an automatic video downloader and only choose my favorite creators. Using this method, I circumvent the most difficult part of youtube to me, the recommended videos sidebar (this, I have determined, is what sucks me in the most). When I run out of downloaded videos, I will have to move on to something else instead of clicking on the Youtube video in the top left corner and starting again with a whole new set of recommended videos. So far I have determined a few people that consistently deliver content I am interested in. Here is my short list of youtubers and reasons why I have decided them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The List:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3Blue1Brown
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Math visualization and problem solving channel, an inspiration for my love of math.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Videos once or twice a month.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wintergatan
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Follwing the Marble Machine X project (engineering)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weekly videos (Wintergatan Wednesdays)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Xisumavoid and TangoTek (Maybe Etho?)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enjoy their creative builds and interesting content, staying up to date with Hermitcraft&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This Old Tony
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Greate machinist channel with refreshing humor and different content&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1-2 weeks per video&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Maybe one more? Northernlion?)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Hopefully this will limit how I interact with the platform in a beneficial way while also maintaining interaction with subject I am interested in. My idea is to have a program that checks at around 9 every day to see if there are any new videos from these creators, download these videos on to my PC, and send me a text notification if this is the case. Youtubes subscription and notification systems are terrible in my opinions and play to the &amp;lsquo;recommendation&amp;rsquo; algorithm instead of being what they advertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These past 2 weeks has been a little disapointing to me as I have slipped back into old habits that I am trying to get rid of.
Last week, I was extremely unproductive trying to work and failed on multiple occasions to hit my hour goal for the day while not being efficient with my programming. I procrastinated the free time I had and depressed my mood. I have accepted this now and have accepted the damage is done with me coming back to the youtube algorithm. I want to change this for the future so I avoid my bad habits, grow more as a person, elevate my mood, and grow my productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week has been exciting to me for other reasons though, and I am in much better spirits now then last week. I have come back to the office space finally at AirCycler (on Monday Jul. 20th). I forgot how much I enjoyed it here with the dogs, my co-workers, and my boss. It is a great environment to work in and I am grateful I have it. My productivity has been much higher here than at home and I am prouder of the work I have generated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, this has been a wild two weeks and in the next span of time, there will probably be more frequent and much less lengthy posts on what I have been doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Signing off,
Jack&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing and reading</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-26-writing-and-reading/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-26-writing-and-reading/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hate writing. The one thing that I can procrastinate to oblivion is writing to the max. Even if it is a short 200-word snippet that is mostly easy to write, starting is always the hardest part. I have found very few ways that help me overcome these feelings, most of which do not work when I am not under pressure. My writing is like a diamond in the rough: Formed under pressure, and unspectacular to the eye until polished. It has always felt that way, through many of the friend groups I&amp;rsquo;ve been in, from what teachers have said, to what I have felt, it has always felt the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels almost like I am better at reading and interpreting poetry. Which is something that I find liberating to write or read, breaking all the norms and rules of prose. I find I can comprehend it better, connect with the symbolish, metaphors, short span, all better. Does not matter the scope or intensity of focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, this writing I am doing for myself is the first journaling/writing project that I have actually enjoyed and done for my own personal enjoyment/benefit. My memory is terrible and this makes it feel like all the little details that slip through the cracks can be caught and archived and indexed. Being able to put a date or a number to the things that happen very occasionally in my life gives me a feeling of documentation and record of &lt;em>my&lt;/em> story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fixed the DNS problems plauging my last night. Now it looks just how I want it. &lt;a href="http://www.jackchampagne.com">www.jackchampagne.com&lt;/a> for the webpage, automatic redirect from jackchampagne.com. Also started strike-thruing my items from the &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo; to mark off what I have completed and adding a few things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess that all I got for now, toodleloo!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- Jack&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What working from home is like</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-25-working-from-home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-25-working-from-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>Working from home has been a big challenge during Coronavirus. Mainly because the lack of a dedicated space that I must work in but also because of the sociality of working from home. It is &lt;em>easy&lt;/em> to stop work at 2 and hang out with friends or my girlfriend and veg out for the rest of the day. It is &lt;em>easy&lt;/em> to get distracted from what I was doing, it is easy to go downstairs and have a bite to eat and read an article. All of these easy things make something simple, like sitting down and typing at a computer hard. It has made me soft; I am complacent with my own laziness, sloth, and ability to &amp;ldquo;not work as hard&amp;rdquo; during these times and I feel as though I have mostly myself to blame. I remember working in a kitchen at the Milepost restaurant for a year before I landed my current job at AirCycler (which is a whole other story) and it was honest work. I remember coming home some night, smelling like a rotting garbage bin and thinking to myself, &amp;ldquo;Wow, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get into the shower and crawl into bed, my body hurts and that was a hell of a day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are things that I am grateful for and some things that I would like to change. Change doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen immediately though, it happens gradually, through consistent effort. Instead of making a 100% improvement on my life today, making a 1% improvement every day for a hundred days will net me 270% change in wellbeing. The second one is far more sustainable (and is another beautiful example of compound interest). My good friend Henry popped into my mind as I am writing this because he wasn&amp;rsquo;t hanging out with the gang earlier today. He works very hard and it is something that I admire. 40 hours a week, waking up at 6:30am, all things that don&amp;rsquo;t seem in reach to me but things that are very attainable through lifestyle changes. Althought right now, maybe this is procrastination with the work that I should be pursuing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier this day, Russell, Luke, Hannah, Dylan, Sam, Lillian, and I went to Dylan&amp;rsquo;s house in Saquish and relaxed on the beach. I was a great day with lots of grilled food, tubing, boating, talking with friends, and playing cornhole. The weather was perfect and it was entertaining to catch up with friends and just do whatever I wanted. I did not get sunburnt surprisingly and I was also very akeen to going swimming even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t bring a proper bathing suit. This is part of the reason why I am writing this. Today was fulfilling, but at the expense of my schedule and routine. I am tired in a good way but yet there is still work left undone. Bubbles needs to be finished and I want to move on from my demons of design and old outdated frameworks (.NET Framework 4.5 and Winforms). I have ideas for the stock market, self-automation, personal business that I want to pursue but do not want to cut my ties at AirCycler. I have enjoyed AirCycler very much and have had a pleasure working on the BATS project as well as this project (Bubbles) I am working on right now. It has been a fulfilling and rewarding expirience that has brought me great people, cool projects, and good connections and I am grateful. I am a bit rambly by now but in some ways I do wish I could go back to the office because I miss interacting with those coworkers. I do miss school because of my friends, the makerspace, and my classes/dorm living. This is the sacrifice that I make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some good news and updates about father&amp;rsquo;s day and life:
My dad and I added a roof to the eagle scout sign project on fathers day. This came as a sign of relief and as one thing less to pester my (and my dad&amp;rsquo;s) thoughts at night. Sally was delighted to see that I had added it and it marked for me on of the last few things that I felt hanging over me from long before this whole thing started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am now beginning to realize at this very moment that to make adding pictures to this blog (which I have really wanted to do) making a python script that automates the process of implementing it onto the blog would be really nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continuing: My grandmother&amp;rsquo;s birthday was recent and, as a surprise, my dad, Hailey, Lillian, and I decided to head out to her and as a surprise for dinner. We ate at Jae&amp;rsquo;s and I drove the entire way there (We met my dad at intersection between 44 and 495 to drop off the Jeep Grand Cherokee). Right when I was about to turn left and head up the hill to the hotel that Jae&amp;rsquo;s in under, I had a problem with the transmission. When I gave the car power, it seemed like the tranmission wasn&amp;rsquo;t enganging and the car wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get into drive. I was able to get it to pop and make it up the hill but 3/4 up the hill, the same thing happened again. This is when I became concerned. I shifted into four-wheel drive and was able to get it to catch again and made it to the hotel parking lot. We all got out of the car and my dad wanted to check on the transmission to see if we were going to need to make alternate plans going home. Reverse still worked fine but my dad, 4-wheel or no 4-wheel, was not able to get the transmission to engage. After 336,000 miles, the iconic 2009 GMC Yukon was dead. It was in the shop for new brake calipers (It still had the original!!) just that weekend and now we were stranded 3 hours from home at my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s birthday dinner. We went in and had a delicious and funny dinner at Jae&amp;rsquo;s. My grandmother, her sister Lynn, my Aunt Suzanne and JG sat at one table and we sat a table right next to them, but slightly apart. I ordered a burger and picked at everyone else orders. My Aunt Suzanne drove us to the Jeep Grand Cherokee in the hotel parking lot to get us home that night and we played crosswords in the car. My dad began the process of purchasing a car and intended on purchasing a car the day before this all happened. Yesterday, he finally purchased the car he wanted, a pickup truck, something that I think is a really good purchase. I have not driven it yet, nor sat in the interior, but when I dropped him off at the dealership to drive it home, the interior looked really nice. This car should last him a while&amp;hellip; I hope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Minecraft 1.16 and 1.16.1 came out on the 23rd and 24th respectively and Lillian and I have been playing them nonstop. I have been busy with the multi-item sorter (so neccessary) while she&amp;rsquo;s been gathering some netherrite. I updated both of my servers and started contemplating a dedicated piece of hardware for all of this and for other projects I am interested in doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also of note: I migrated back to Github pages because of the website bloat that Netlify was causing. To properly use netlify, I would have to added a few things that I did not want. I want this site to be lightweight (other than the photos I guess) and want each aspect to be tightly controlled. It was a fairly smooth process in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, I think I have put off work long enough, or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m ready to just give up for the night and call it a day. Who knows?? (me, calling it a day)
Till next time,
Jack&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also just want to say briefly that moments ago (you can look at commits now, I found the www. subdomain was not working, currently trying to fix)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Birthday 2020</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-16-birthday-recently/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-16-birthday-recently/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past weekend was my birthday weekend and I got home from staying at my moms on the 13th. When we were up there we did a tremendous amount of yardwork. When I got home, my grandmother was down to visit. I learned how to make her incredible Kahlua cheesecake and spent time with her catching up. My dad announced on the 13th or the 14th that getting a dog this fall is almost certain. On the 14th, I got a terrible sunburn when me and my girlfriend went out to Saquish to look for moon snails and have a bit of a picnic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my birthday I recieved two gifts that I am looking forward to using. The first is an apple watch, which I am wearing right now. The second is a Kindle, which I would like to use to read in bed at night instead of my phone screen. Hopefully the display is not backlit like a normal lcd display and the tablet is suitable for nighttime reading. I also recieved new shoes from my mom which I have wanted badly these past couple of weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I get older, a birthday just feels like another normal day. If I was asked by someone how old I am, I&amp;rsquo;d probably respond with 18 accidentally still. This is the reality but fortunately I have not gotten to the point where I say an age from two years ago. I have found some difficulty and trouble trying to motivate to do work. The tasks that I have set out at AirCycler seem very doable and are broken up into bite size chunks but I find the work to be less interesting than that which I decide to do for my own personal improvement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some things I wanted to jot down for some note taking:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I started the cryptography and micro/macro economics course on Khan Academy earlier this summer. And have not been doing that recently. (At one point I found myself needing pen and paper to organize my thoughts for the cryptography and econ quizzes, which made it more difficult to do before bed and such)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also have many other books I would like to read and &lt;del>a Scientific American magazine&lt;/del> to get through as well. (10 python books to read)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I also want to note that my python script for sending me text from my computer does not work now for unknown reasons. I am unable to connect to gmail&amp;rsquo;s smtp server.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I have not watched youtube in weeks&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how long it has been but life has felt more fulfilling, busy, and peaceful recently. I feel like I am taking care of the people around me better and sometimes I feel like I am taking care of myself better (although this morning I lay in bed for nearly an hour, a habit that I am going to start to break)&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to start reading my next python book on my kindle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to clean the garage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to put a roof on the Green&amp;rsquo;s Harbor trailhead sign (for my Eagle Scout project)&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to get enough sleep and exercise every day! (Can track these things now using my apple watch)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to work 20 hours a week consistently and put away 25% of everything that I make.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to get more nighttime photography (Was about to last night but instead wrote a summary of campus&amp;rsquo; plans to repopulate to my friends)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to clean my room again, there is too much on the walls&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to set up a little stand at the base of my bed for a projector setup&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to write more of these posts. (Am wondering right now if having this private information exposed is a privacy concern of mine.)&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to create a comprehensive todo list focused around my health&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to set up an r-pi cluster compute server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to get my part 107&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to play more minecraft with my girlfriend&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to spend more time on discord calls with friend and in-person risk-mitigated hangouts&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to spend more time around Lillian&amp;rsquo;s family to connect more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to program guis in flutter to try it out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to learn options and market information through Cboe and others&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to play guitar more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to automate more of my life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to plan out Dyken pond trips with my friends this summer.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to bike more.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to go to bed earlier and get more sleep.&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to have more time? Make more time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to camp and go on more hikes&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to &lt;em>clean&lt;/em> my mom&amp;rsquo;s car&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to see moon snails&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to start my web programming course again on khan academy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to continue my python code-academy course (or find a different service)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to continue learning c and c++&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>( 6-25-2020 )&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I want to give myself more time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to be the best that I can be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;del>I want to get right out of bed and wake up earlier (8am)&lt;/del>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I want a lot of things in life. And it always seems like there&amp;rsquo;s just not enought time. One small thing at a time though, and I know it will get done. I know it will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This could have a ton of tags but because of the nature of this list, I think I am going to keep it with only these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Till next time,
- Jack&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dyken Pond</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-11-dyken-pond-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-06-11-dyken-pond-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been an awesome week! Finishing the Lord of the Rings trilogy concluded with an epic 3hr movie session with my girlfriend (Wednesday afternoon). I have to say, in the beginning, it felt as though I would not be able to become as attached to the characters as I did in the hobbits. The trilogy&amp;rsquo;s different style coupled with the lack of Bilbo, the Dwarves, and Gandalf made it difficult. At the end of nearly 10 hours of movie almost solely featuring the Fellowship of the Ring, I am just as attached to the characters as I was in &lt;em>The Hobbit&lt;/em> trilogy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday night, my sister and I traveled up to dyken pond to see my mother and to enjoy some time in the country. It is always so peaceful out here. The rain on the tin roof is always one of my favorite sounds out here. The new grass has been mowed at the camp and in Center Berlin, there is plenty of yard work to do!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also finished reading the book I have been working on &lt;em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&lt;/em> by Al Sweigart and I must say, I really enjoyed the read. I learned a lot about internet protcols (http, smtp, sms), filetypes, python&amp;rsquo;s inner workings, character encodings (I really didn&amp;rsquo;t know the world needed to be this complicated), windows command line and more from this book. I am currently deciding which book to read next out of 10 that I bought in a bundle about a year ago. Last night, finding something that I could apply my newfound knowledge to, I created a process of copying text from my laptop, to my phone using text. The full source code &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jack-champagne/947c94b75e4acaf1b22e25198002c689">is on github as a gist&lt;/a> feel free to check it out! (It&amp;rsquo;s really short). I used the smtplib, and Verizon&amp;rsquo;s email sms gateway service to send data to my phone. I was able to have my python program get text either from command line or clipboard, send it over email to a special address @vtext.com (Verizon&amp;rsquo;s email to sms gateway) which then got sent to my phone. THis was free, fast, and clean in my opinion. Works like a charm in my opinion! The motivation for this came out of need for a way to send text over to my phone (like copy and paste) from my windows machine. On Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy as it would just be a quick iMessage to myself. But there is no iMessage on windows, so here is my alternative!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also want to note and record that me and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s minecraft world has progressed and we beat the Wither, minecraft&amp;rsquo;s other boss, on Monday. The fight seemed a little bugged (or maybe I lack expirience) but the Wither was acting strangely and then targeted me, killing me and destroying nearly all of my stuff (not Elytra!). I was not that upset thought, now I have truly moved on to the endgame. Also, the day before, we raided the Woodland Mansion and obtained totems of undying (which I used during wither fight :sad: ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All for now!

&lt;p>And I am very aware of it. About five days ago, I made a promise to myself after my last experiment with &lt;em>quitting&lt;/em> youtube failed. I thought that I would be able to curb my Youtube habit by limiting myself to only watching what I came to the site to watch. This way I would not browse and fall victim to their powerful recommendation algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This failed, and it failed by slow loosening of the rules and gradual slippage back into prior habits. Because of this, I made a decision to &lt;strong>stop&lt;/strong> watching Youtube completely for the time being. This means I cannot go on my laptop, cannot go on the app, cannot watch it on the Tv, and cannot watch a quick video that a friend may have sent me. It is a strict ban for probably forever. If I ever wanted to use the platform again, I am thinking of a couple of ways that I could do so in a completely non-addictive and fully informative matter. One method is that I must download the videos (that I was thinking of watching) first on to my device to seperate myself from the platform. I would not be allowed to let Youtube&amp;rsquo;s algorithm serve me what to watch but instead I must know it beforehand. This will be far into the future where I can live completely seperate from the need to watch video.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another note, I have been reading &lt;em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&lt;/em> by Al Sweigart (which I will abbrv. as ABSP) and so far I have really enjoyed it. I am currently on the filesystem chapter and the section that details how to use python to compress (&amp;ldquo;zip&amp;rdquo;) files. I am looking forward to later chapters, particularly the ones on webscraping and &lt;em>sending emails and texts&lt;/em> 😮 with python. Last night, on a short call with my friend Matt Keating, we discussed python and a few programming things over the phone while I toured the cathedral that he was building on the ski guys minecraft server. He reminded me of a website that I have been fond of but have only now come back to: &lt;a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler&lt;/a> is a collection of programming puzzles on algorithms, data-structures, optimization and more. Solving the problems it presents is a unique challenge (much like &lt;a href="https://www.codeabbey.com/">Code Abbey&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://code.golf/">Code Golf&lt;/a>) that is rewarding. I have signed back up and hopefully the python that I have learned from this book, I can properly apply for some good problem solving.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="priorites">Priorites&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A list of priorities is always important, especially for the person who likes to work on a thousand other problems before solving the big daunting problem that has been hanging over their head for weeks (me). I read an article this morning from Harvard Business Review about self-sabotaging behaviours which is what has inspired this section. So here is my current list of priorities to myself:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>My Health is most important and I think that focusing on this is one of the most valuable things I can do for myself. (Sleep, excersize, hygiene)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Staying away from all the time wasters (Youtube, Snapchat, etc&amp;hellip;) and instead replacing them with something else, like reading out of ABSP.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spending quality time with those around me (Family, friends, and my girlfriend)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keeping my room clean and establishing a good routine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>And priorities to others:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two days ago, I was able to get the site to build on netlify. The site displayed correctly and as of right now uses the slick theme. As of writing this, I will be working on migrating all of the old site content over to this new site and hooking it up to my domain (&lt;a href="https://jackchampagne.com">https://jackchampagne.com&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will be updating this throughout the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4:00pm&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So! It&amp;rsquo;s not quite the morning anymore but a TON of stuff has been changed. As I would like to make changes to this theme in the future, I have forked the theme&amp;rsquo;s repo and added it as a git submodule in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-champagne/tidbits">source&lt;/a>. I have also reformatted posts (added categories, tags, and series) and gotten my DNS (hover.com) to use Netlify&amp;rsquo;s nameservers. This will enable me to use their CMS (Content Managment System) and CI (Continuous Integration). Having my domain point to Netlify was as easy as pie this time. Migrating hosts (previously &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages&lt;/a>) to Netlify provides numerous advantages, especially the relaxing of the &amp;lsquo;static&amp;rsquo; aspect of the site. Netlify will handle form submissions (providing for email and polling and other fun stuff) and their CI + CMS is really nice. (And it&amp;rsquo;s free! A big emphasis everywhere for me)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4:08pm&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now trying to do a local build on my machine before I push the repos to be built on the web! Fingers crossed that cats, tags, and series work properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4:13pm&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First build failed because of a missing space on line 10 of 2020-04-25-galactic-dinosaurs.md in between the &lt;code>-&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Science&lt;/code>. Second build failed because I didn&amp;rsquo;t save. Third build succeeded in 5 seconds (Whoa, this is supposed to be a lightweight theme!). Looking at the built site, I noticed a typo that created two tags that were meant to be one: &lt;code>Self-improvment&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Self-improvement&lt;/code> were merged and then I build again. Now that everything looks good, time to commit these changes and let the magic of CI take over!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Talk soon,
Jack&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dyken Pond</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-05-30-dyken-pond-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-05-30-dyken-pond-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today was my first day back at Dyken pond for real, meaning sleeping at the camp. Last weekend, my mom and Chris ripped up the old setup around the firepit and put down sod and seed. It looks and feels so nice. Instead of stepping on rocks and pine needles every time we go outside this year, we will be laying in a bed of grass, so nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday was yesterday and even though there was a ton of stuff that we did not get to do, it was a jam-packed day. I learned that she has never really done origami before. I planned on &lt;em>possibly&lt;/em> building birdhouses, playing &lt;em>Hey There Delilah&lt;/em> by the Plain White T&amp;rsquo;s on guitar for her (wasn&amp;rsquo;t practiced enough yet!) building the lego set that Sean Henderson gave to her for her birthday, and doing a puzzle. We ran out of time! We also watched three episodes of spongebob though, starting from the beginning of course. I am surprised that I have seen every episode so far before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, and at the lake!

It is so easy to get stuck in a hole and preform the same routine day in and day out. I believe that novelty forces people to grow and makes days feel more fulfilling. This list focuses on, at max, 10 core concepts that are worth paying attention to throughout each day of my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(5/27/2020)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Active Learning (doing myself) is far more powerful then passive learning (watching do)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do it perfect the first time, instead I should just get something down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1% of improvement every day is better than 0% (By the end of the year, that will be 3778% improvement annually)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting enough sleep is essential&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spending time with those around you&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>(9/16/2020)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck on your bad habits. See where you went wrong, prevent it from happening in the future and grow.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are more to be added and as the list goes on some may be deleted. A format to describe the dates on the list will be made in the future. *For now, all of the list items were added on the start date of this post. This will almost act like a sticky note / bulletin board for my thoughts on my path towards productivity.&lt;/p>

The precursor to the &lt;em>Lord of the Rings&lt;/em> series by J. R. R. Tolkien. I have to say a few things about the series so far. For one, I was surprised to see the middle movie &lt;em>Desolation of Smaug&lt;/em> have signifigantly lower (only slightly) ratings than the other two movies overall. After watching the movie it made a lot of sense to my as to why. If I had to watch that movie in movie theaters and the next movie &lt;em>Battle of Five Armies&lt;/em> hadn&amp;rsquo;t come out yet, I would have been deeply frustrated with the ending. The movie finished off on a cliff-hanger that was far too-intense for my liking. I enjoy having movies leave some to be desired so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel too conclusive but having a dragon (Smaug) moments away from descending down on a town and causing death and destruction and then ending the movie was a bit of a cop out in my opinion. Since I was watching these movies after all of them have been released, that frustration wasn&amp;rsquo;t there and actually was something I found to be a positive. The previous movie, of course, now led in perfectly to the final movie, picking up right where we left off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I am getting some work done for AirCycler and am taking the day for myself. So far it has been quite slow and my recent Youtube ban has been a little bit of a failure. I am learning though! From my failures that is. I defeated Reddit two years ago now and am looking at implementing a better system for myself. I believe that less of the time-sucker apps and content in my life will contribute to a bigger feeling of fulfillment, better sleep, better mental health, and better motivation. Overall this will free up my time for other activities that I also enjoy but will be more informative, interesting, and fulfilling. I would like to read the book &lt;em>Automate the Boring stuff&lt;/em> by Al Sweigart. I find it could be very useful in the future for me, getting rid of the monotonous tasks that I will envitably have to do. I would also like to read the textbook &lt;em>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos&lt;/em> by Steven H. Strogatz which so far has been very interesting and enlightening. (Those challenge problems are pretty hard!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Till next time,

Seems reasonable. Poultry is everywhere&amp;hellip;
There is a lot of misinformationa about what is really the most eaten meat (goat, beef, pork) from reputable sources and what you here from word of mouth. I had a good friend tell me today that his dad always says that &amp;lsquo;Goat is the most eaten meat in the world&amp;rsquo;. I really wanted to add this to tidbits because it sounded so interesting. So, I did a little fact checking first before I wrote this article. It turns out, from what I have found this is a common misconception as people like Gordon Ramsey and commenters on the meat articles have said this repeatedly. This is not true though, poultry is the most eaten meat in the world as claimed by this &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-the-most-consumed-meats-in-the-world?share=1">Quora article&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

This is Jack. Just writing a short update on the site itself and what&amp;rsquo;s going on behind the scenes =]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working hard at getting this website viewable to the public and was originally planning on using Github pages with Jekyll. Jekyll is awesome and has a lot of uses for building static sites and blogs just like this. Unfortunately, properly installing a ruby development environment was not a trivial task! I tried many guides but alas there was no success. (Jekyll&amp;rsquo;s guide, Mike Dane&amp;rsquo;s guide on Youtube, a few others that fleet my memory as of right now)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of ways of installing and managing your installs of Ruby and each one I tried came with its own set of difficulties. (Rbenv, base install) and there are a lot of tools and &amp;lsquo;gems&amp;rsquo; that ruby uses for jekyll and github pages. Between bundler, rbenv, and my setup (Windows subsystem for linux running Ubuntu 20.04) I decided that I should re-evaluate my options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I have researched static site generators for a short stint at a company called &lt;em>Novice Games&lt;/em> (Summer 2019) with my high school classmates of Jack Roche and Nate Romanelli. The two most popular ones that I found were Jeykll and Hugo. When I came to revaluate this site&amp;rsquo;s future in development, Hugo became what is now my main focus to get this published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I intend on publishing this site using Hugo (written in the go programming language) and have CI taken care of through Github actions (if possible)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not know much CI at the moment but the CI setup on the UMass-Makerspace&amp;rsquo;s blog was something that I saw real power in and will attempt to apply it to many problems in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anywho, the makerspace wrapped up activities for the semester and we ended on a good note as a team. I am looking forward to the summer, getting to spend a little time with my girlfriend, working at AirCycler© (which I will be doing remotely, woohoo!), doing some manual labor in Berlin, NY for my family (Dyken Pond &amp;amp; Center Berlin), and taking care of stuff at home in Duxbury.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>No seriously, pick any city in China and zoom into it. It looks fine at first, especially when only on the default map view. But if you choose satellite view, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice some weird stuff pretty fast. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice roads going over oceans and streets not aligning with satellite imagery. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice businesses that seem out of place. Basically satellite view and street view don&amp;rsquo;t align.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is because to be able to do surveys of China, you need permission from the Chinese government. The only company(ies?) that have surveying permissions of China are Chinese companies. So, the satellite imagery you see of China is correct, but all of roads, business locations, and land borders are all messed up because google is not authorized to use actual mapping data of Chinese land. I think the original video I saw on this topic was a video from &lt;em>Half as Interesting&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Di-UVC-_4">Here&amp;rsquo;s the link&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Super-generations exist</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-04-30-monarch-cycles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-04-30-monarch-cycles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that every 4th generation of monarch butterflies, specifically the generation the flies from the southern United States to their winter migration spot in Mexico live 10x longer than the three generations that came before them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first episode of a documentary series I watched today by National Geographic called &lt;em>Great Migrations&lt;/em>, Nat. Geo. explored the Monarch butterflies migration patterns. The migration cycle is a year long cycler that spans 4 generations of butterflies. Every 6-8 weeks, monarchs lay their eggs hundreds of miles southward of where they were born and begin a new generation. On the last leg of their journey, monarchs give rise to one more generation coined a &amp;lsquo;super-generation&amp;rsquo; that lives 10x longer (~6-7 months long) who then makes the long journey into the center of Mexico. They live mostly sedentary lives here until the cycle begins again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lightning strikes the earth a lot more than you think</title><link>https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-04-29-lightning-rate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jackchampagne.r@gmail.com (Jack Champagne)</author><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jack-champagne.github.io/posts/2020-04-29-lightning-rate/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

This is a little disheartening but there are lots of reasons why and many excuses I could make. Normally, I would try and recount for the lost ~10 days of journalling but I do not have the time to do that today and do not want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My love for what I do at AirCycler has been rekindled, I find myself enjoying what I am learning in my classes much more than previously, but I have a lot of wasted time in my day. Youtube, lack of control over my priorities and tasks I need to do for other people, it has been interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few things have occurred to me that are interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An open repository of interactive knowledge (Desmos graphs, problems, visualizations, and proofs) when it comes to math, physics, chemistry, and a whole slew of other things would be super cool. I imagine taking what I learn in class and making nice pretty visualizations of it for everyone involved helping overall understanding of concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not a bad programmer, I find that I beat myself up sometimes because I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out where a bug is originating from, or writing code that isn&amp;rsquo;t bug free, but this is a part of the process. It is hard to keep track of all the things that are going on in ones head all the time and writing codes is just prone to making mistakes. That being said, I am proud of how I am doing in my current college computer science course, CS187 - Data structures and algorithms.
