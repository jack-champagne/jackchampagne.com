## Tidbits

This is currently the markdown source for my statically generated webpage hosted on github pages. It includes a number of pages, posts, and pieces of media that I have found/made over the years. Here is a short list of what is on this:

- Main site (collection of titled and dated pieces from my head on a variety of topics)
- Blog (Math blog post on fibonnaci numbers, spirals, recurrence formulas)
- Desmos demos (Couple of small visualizations in desmos for various mathematical gadgets.

Other smaller pages
- roo page
- LaTeX rendering page
- informal resume page
- informal CV page 

This is a personal project of mine to write down all the little "factoids" that I stumble
across day to day. Hope you enjoy!
