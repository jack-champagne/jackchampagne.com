There is a lot of misinformationa about what is really the most eaten meat (goat, beef, pork) from reputable sources and what you here from word of mouth. I had a good friend tell me today that his dad always says that &lsquo;Goat is the most eaten meat in the world&rsquo;. I really wanted to add this to tidbits because it sounded so interesting. So, I did a little fact checking first before I wrote this article. It turns out, from what I have found this is a common misconception as people like Gordon Ramsey and commenters on the meat articles have said this repeatedly. This is not true though, poultry is the most eaten meat in the world as claimed by this <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-the-most-consumed-meats-in-the-world?share=1">Quora article</a></p><p>Today was a social distancing outside hangout with Henry, Russell, Luke, Lillian, and Sam outside tossing the disc and playing sports. I have finally on this day cleaned my room and sorted all of my college dorm room stuff back into my room in Duxbury. I had my moveout day
this past monday (5/18/2020) and now at the end of the week everything is in order. So clean!</p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2020-05-13-site-update-1/>An update about this site</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

Just writing a short update on the site itself and what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes =]</p><p>I have been working hard at getting this website viewable to the public and was originally planning on using Github pages with Jekyll. Jekyll is awesome and has a lot of uses for building static sites and blogs just like this. Unfortunately, properly installing a ruby development environment was not a trivial task! I tried many guides but alas there was no success. (Jekyll&rsquo;s guide, Mike Dane&rsquo;s guide on Youtube, a few others that fleet my memory as of right now)</p><p>There are lots of ways of installing and managing your installs of Ruby and each one I tried came with its own set of difficulties. (Rbenv, base install) and there are a lot of tools and &lsquo;gems&rsquo; that ruby uses for jekyll and github pages. Between bundler, rbenv, and my setup (Windows subsystem for linux running Ubuntu 20.04) I decided that I should re-evaluate my options.</p><p>In the past I have researched static site generators for a short stint at a company called <em>Novice Games</em> (Summer 2019) with my high school classmates of Jack Roche and Nate Romanelli. The two most popular ones that I found were Jeykll and Hugo. When I came to revaluate this site&rsquo;s future in development, Hugo became what is now my main focus to get this published.</p><p>I intend on publishing this site using Hugo (written in the go programming language) and have CI taken care of through Github actions (if possible)</p><p>I do not know much CI at the moment but the CI setup on the UMass-Makerspace&rsquo;s blog was something that I saw real power in and will attempt to apply it to many problems in the future.</p><p>Anywho, the makerspace wrapped up activities for the semester and we ended on a good note as a team. I am looking forward to the summer, getting to spend a little time with my girlfriend, working at AirCycler© (which I will be doing remotely, woohoo!), doing some manual labor in Berlin, NY for my family (Dyken Pond & Center Berlin), and taking care of stuff at home in Duxbury.</p><p>Hope this was a good read if you were curious!
Talk soon,
Jack</p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2020-05-08-metric-america/>America signed a metric treaty</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

But if you choose satellite view, you&rsquo;ll notice some weird stuff pretty fast. You&rsquo;ll notice roads going over oceans and streets not aligning with satellite imagery. You&rsquo;ll notice businesses that seem out of place. Basically satellite view and street view don&rsquo;t align.</p><p>This is because to be able to do surveys of China, you need permission from the Chinese government. The only company(ies?) that have surveying permissions of China are Chinese companies. So, the satellite imagery you see of China is correct, but all of roads, business locations, and land borders are all messed up because google is not authorized to use actual mapping data of Chinese land.

Geo. explored the Monarch butterflies migration patterns. The migration cycle is a year long cycler that spans 4 generations of butterflies. Every 6-8 weeks, monarchs lay their eggs hundreds of miles southward of where they were born and begin a new generation. On the last leg of their journey, monarchs give rise to one more generation coined a &lsquo;super-generation&rsquo; that lives 10x longer (~6-7 months long) who then makes the long journey into the center of Mexico. They live mostly sedentary lives here until the cycle begins again.</p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2020-04-29-lightning-rate/>Lightning strikes the earth a lot more than you think</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [
