As of writing this, I will be working on migrating all of the old site content over to this new site and hooking it up to my domain (<a href=https://jackchampagne.com>https://jackchampagne.com</a>)</p><p>Will be updating this throughout the morning.</p><p>4:00pm</p><p>So! It&rsquo;s not quite the morning anymore but a TON of stuff has been changed. As I would like to make changes to this theme in the future, I have forked the theme&rsquo;s repo and added it as a git submodule in the <a href=https://github.com/jack-champagne/tidbits>source</a>. I have also reformatted posts (added categories, tags, and series) and gotten my DNS (hover.com) to use Netlify&rsquo;s nameservers. This will enable me to use their CMS (Content Managment System) and CI (Continuous Integration). Having my domain point to Netlify was as easy as pie this time. Migrating hosts (previously <a href=https://pages.github.com/>github pages</a>) to Netlify provides numerous advantages, especially the relaxing of the &lsquo;static&rsquo; aspect of the site. Netlify will handle form submissions (providing for email and polling and other fun stuff) and their CI + CMS is really nice. (And it&rsquo;s free! A big emphasis everywhere for me)</p><p>4:08pm</p><p>Now trying to do a local build on my machine before I push the repos to be built on the web! Fingers crossed that cats, tags, and series work properly.</p><p>4:13pm</p><p>First build failed because of a missing space on line 10 of 2020-04-25-galactic-dinosaurs.md in between the <code>-</code> and <code>Science</code>. Second build failed because I didn&rsquo;t save. Third build succeeded in 5 seconds (Whoa, this is supposed to be a lightweight theme!). Looking at the built site, I noticed a typo that created two tags that were meant to be one: <code>Self-improvment</code> and <code>Self-improvement</code> were merged and then I build again. Now that everything looks good, time to commit these changes and let the magic of CI take over!</p><p>Talk soon,

The precursor to the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> series by J. R. R. Tolkien. I have to say a few things about the series so far. For one, I was surprised to see the middle movie <em>Desolation of Smaug</em> have signifigantly lower (only slightly) ratings than the other two movies overall. After watching the movie it made a lot of sense to my as to why. If I had to watch that movie in movie theaters and the next movie <em>Battle of Five Armies</em> hadn&rsquo;t come out yet, I would have been deeply frustrated with the ending. The movie finished off on a cliff-hanger that was far too-intense for my liking. I enjoy having movies leave some to be desired so it doesn&rsquo;t feel too conclusive but having a dragon (Smaug) moments away from descending down on a town and causing death and destruction and then ending the movie was a bit of a cop out in my opinion. Since I was watching these movies after all of them have been released, that frustration wasn&rsquo;t there and actually was something I found to be a positive. The previous movie, of course, now led in perfectly to the final movie, picking up right where we left off.</p><p>Today, I am getting some work done for AirCycler and am taking the day for myself. So far it has been quite slow and my recent Youtube ban has been a little bit of a failure. I am learning though! From my failures that is. I defeated Reddit two years ago now and am looking at implementing a better system for myself. I believe that less of the time-sucker apps and content in my life will contribute to a bigger feeling of fulfillment, better sleep, better mental health, and better motivation. Overall this will free up my time for other activities that I also enjoy but will be more informative, interesting, and fulfilling. I would like to read the book <em>Automate the Boring stuff</em> by Al Sweigart. I find it could be very useful in the future for me, getting rid of the monotonous tasks that I will envitably have to do. I would also like to read the textbook <em>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</em> by Steven H. Strogatz which so far has been very interesting and enlightening. (Those challenge problems are pretty hard!)</p><p>Till next time,

There is a lot of misinformationa about what is really the most eaten meat (goat, beef, pork) from reputable sources and what you here from word of mouth. I had a good friend tell me today that his dad always says that &lsquo;Goat is the most eaten meat in the world&rsquo;. I really wanted to add this to tidbits because it sounded so interesting. So, I did a little fact checking first before I wrote this article. It turns out, from what I have found this is a common misconception as people like Gordon Ramsey and commenters on the meat articles have said this repeatedly. This is not true though, poultry is the most eaten meat in the world as claimed by this <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-the-most-consumed-meats-in-the-world?share=1">Quora article</a></p><p>Today was a social distancing outside hangout with Henry, Russell, Luke, Lillian, and Sam outside tossing the disc and playing sports.

Just writing a short update on the site itself and what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes =]</p><p>I have been working hard at getting this website viewable to the public and was originally planning on using Github pages with Jekyll. Jekyll is awesome and has a lot of uses for building static sites and blogs just like this. Unfortunately, properly installing a ruby development environment was not a trivial task! I tried many guides but alas there was no success. (Jekyll&rsquo;s guide, Mike Dane&rsquo;s guide on Youtube, a few others that fleet my memory as of right now)</p><p>There are lots of ways of installing and managing your installs of Ruby and each one I tried came with its own set of difficulties. (Rbenv, base install) and there are a lot of tools and &lsquo;gems&rsquo; that ruby uses for jekyll and github pages. Between bundler, rbenv, and my setup (Windows subsystem for linux running Ubuntu 20.04) I decided that I should re-evaluate my options.</p><p>In the past I have researched static site generators for a short stint at a company called <em>Novice Games</em> (Summer 2019) with my high school classmates of Jack Roche and Nate Romanelli. The two most popular ones that I found were Jeykll and Hugo. When I came to revaluate this site&rsquo;s future in development, Hugo became what is now my main focus to get this published.</p><p>I intend on publishing this site using Hugo (written in the go programming language) and have CI taken care of through Github actions (if possible)</p><p>I do not know much CI at the moment but the CI setup on the UMass-Makerspace&rsquo;s blog was something that I saw real power in and will attempt to apply it to many problems in the future.</p><p>Anywho, the makerspace wrapped up activities for the semester and we ended on a good note as a team. I am looking forward to the summer, getting to spend a little time with my girlfriend, working at AirCycler© (which I will be doing remotely, woohoo!), doing some manual labor in Berlin, NY for my family (Dyken Pond & Center Berlin), and taking care of stuff at home in Duxbury.</p><p>Hope this was a good read if you were curious!

But if you choose satellite view, you&rsquo;ll notice some weird stuff pretty fast. You&rsquo;ll notice roads going over oceans and streets not aligning with satellite imagery. You&rsquo;ll notice businesses that seem out of place. Basically satellite view and street view don&rsquo;t align.</p><p>This is because to be able to do surveys of China, you need permission from the Chinese government. The only company(ies?) that have surveying permissions of China are Chinese companies. So, the satellite imagery you see of China is correct, but all of roads, business locations, and land borders are all messed up because google is not authorized to use actual mapping data of Chinese land.
