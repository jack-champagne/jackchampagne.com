The United States <em>intended</em> on converting to the metric system. Instead we have a beautiful system where all of our units are metric units and a conversion factor.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the complexity of the Imperial system in all of its glory yet, check out this wikipedia image.

I went through all 7 of my golden apples, my 2 regeneration potions, my 3 slow falling potions, and 64 arrows. It was hard work getting to this point but this is <em>the first time I have done it completely legit, no commands</em>. We immediately got an end city, got one elytra, and then another end city and another elytra. Earlier that same day, I finished 3 classes of mine for Spring Semester at UMass Amherst.</p><p>A list of the classes I have taken and are taking can be found elsewhere on my website. Maybe on my projects page!
As of writing, these files still haven&rsquo;t been made into a webpage.

But if you choose satellite view, you&rsquo;ll notice some weird stuff pretty fast. You&rsquo;ll notice roads going over oceans and streets not aligning with satellite imagery. You&rsquo;ll notice businesses that seem out of place. Basically satellite view and street view don&rsquo;t align.</p><p>This is because to be able to do surveys of China, you need permission from the Chinese government. The only company(ies?) that have surveying permissions of China are Chinese companies. So, the satellite imagery you see of China is correct, but all of roads, business locations, and land borders are all messed up because google is not authorized to use actual mapping data of Chinese land. I think the original video I saw on this topic was a video from <em>Half as Interesting</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Di-UVC-_4">Here&rsquo;s the link</a></p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2020-04-30-monarch-cycles/>Super-generations exist</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

Geo. explored the Monarch butterflies migration patterns. The migration cycle is a year long cycler that spans 4 generations of butterflies. Every 6-8 weeks, monarchs lay their eggs hundreds of miles southward of where they were born and begin a new generation. On the last leg of their journey, monarchs give rise to one more generation coined a &lsquo;super-generation&rsquo; that lives 10x longer (~6-7 months long) who then makes the long journey into the center of Mexico. They live mostly sedentary lives here until the cycle begins again.</p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2020-04-29-lightning-rate/>Lightning strikes the earth a lot more than you think</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

I finished the last episode yesterday there was a shot of elephants with a lightning show in the background. It was beautiful and it reminded me of when I learned of this statistic years ago reading one of my books.
