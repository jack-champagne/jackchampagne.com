I finally put my website behind cloudflare (for a number of reasons) and configured everything earlier today to get it working again. The main sticking point for me was Github re-issuing an SSL certificate for the website after the DNS change. I also added an email address that forwards to my personal email with a jackchampagne.com extension.</p><p>The main reason that I put the website behind cloudflare was because of their Yubikeys offer (10 for $10 each discounted price).

Last Tuesday I had an interview with BETA Technologies for the embedded systems team. The next day (Wed, 4/13/22) I got the offer! Super excited about that. Talked to Jason Wolfson at AirCycler today to let him know that I am not coming back and chatted about aircraft for a bit. I have stumbled across another video that I find extremely good and was inspired to make a curated list of some of the best youtube videos I have watched over the years. The videos will be loosely educational, hopefully leaving the watchers with a sense of satisifaction and having learned something new or seen something beautiful</p><p>Thank you!

I love open-source because the code is auditable, security can be reviewed just by looking at the source, the software isn&rsquo;t an opaque black box, and it creates a community around a piece of software.</p><p>Each one of these has side-effects that are, for the most part, beneficial to everyone.</p><ul><li>Privacy that is verifiable and trackable</li><li>Security through bug reports and whatever patching process the project has</li><li>The power of anyone being able to propose changes to ensure a piece of software is working as intended for whatever use case</li><li>Support through others on forums, community wikis, and project documentation</li></ul><p>The &lsquo;Free&rsquo; in free and open-source software does not primarily represent the price (although all free software does not cost money). The &lsquo;Free&rsquo; stands for <em>free</em>dom. That is, the freedom to use, distribute, modify software as you please. This is a beautiful thing. There is no such thing as &lsquo;sunsetting&rsquo; a free and open-source software project, the community of those who use the software have the freedom to maintain it. You are protected from feature regression of features that you need. Paywalls for features shouldn&rsquo;t be a thing, and if a project is truly free and open-source, you can modify it and redistribute as you wish.</p><p>In a sense, free and open-source software is like writing software where the code that gets put in is democratically accepted by a project community. If a project maintainer goes haywire and starts accepting questionably contributions and changes to their project, the community can make a fork. If the fork is truly better than the original, there is no reason why it can&rsquo;t become the dominant and most widely-used version.</p><p>I like machines, tools, and ideas that <strong>last forever</strong>. People buy lathes from the 1960s because they are reasonably accurate but will last forever. Free and open-source software are the <em>software tools</em> that will last me forever.

Hailey and my father stayed home today and they instead took her which took some time pressure off of me. Once I got home, me and Lillian sat down on the couch and promptly took a 20 minute power nap (a really good one too might I add!)</p><p>This weekend was fantastic, lots of activities, canning, good food, and tons of laughs. Lillian and I left on Friday (9/18) at around 3ish so that we could make it in time for dinner to my moms. We made an italian style dinner with spaghetti and used the bread from brothers for olive oil dipping goodness. The meatballs in the tomato sauce were perfectly cooked and balanced everything out quite well.</p><p>The following day, we had a slow morning followed by a busy afternoon of going to farm stands to get ingredients (corn, tomatoes, and such) for tomorrow. We got back up to the lake and took the four wheeler out for a bit (which is in great shape!)&mldr; the dirt bike unfortunately did not want to start. We went to Norte, a mexican style restaurant in Stephentown, NY and the food was extremely delicious. Next time I go, I know I can fall back on a chicken chimichanga, the tortilla outside was perfection. We socialized with Mark Prescott, Ben, and Martha towards the end of our evening there and headed back to the camp where I gave Lillian a grueling Calc II lesson on integration, derivatives, and the definition of an integral (which she understood quite well). Zonk</p><p>On Sunday, we woke up, had some breakfast and starting doing homework almost right away. It was a busy day and also I got to see for the first time how much more homework Lillian had this semester over me (1st semester was equal, 2nd semester was busy for me, this one was busy for her). We then drove up the mountain to Dyken pond to do some chores, canning and also making of horseradish. Ron showed Mark, Ben, Me, my mom, Chris, and Lillian how to make horseradish from the roots. My mom gave me a brief walkthrough reminding me the steps of tomato canning.</p><ol><li>Sanitize the cans (don&rsquo;t want to get botulism)</li><li>Score the skin of the tomatoes</li><li>Boil for 30 seconds for skin to peel back</li><li>Core and remove all skin</li><li>Cut into eights or sizable pieces and put into mason jars.</li><li>Put 1 tbsp of salt with the tomatoes in the mason jar.</li><li>Properly seal lids finger tight</li><li>Place jars into warm water and bring to boil. Once boiling, let boil for 25 minutes.</li><li>Let cool slowly to avoid cracking and check seals.</li></ol><p>It is very messy but that is what makes it fun. Lillian and I had homework to do so we went back down the hill to get the rest of her math quiz done. I had taught her a lot of concepts and heplful things to know when she is doing integration. She really hooked on to the integration with e^x in the integrand which was cool to see. Then from there, she really understood what u substitution was doing (reverse chain rule). Doing reverse product rule (integration by parts) was a little more difficult as getting across the theory is hard to do intuitively for me. I gave her the mnemonic LIATE which really helped and lots of reminders about u = and dv = integrations. Always always always don&rsquo;t forget your dx&rsquo;s! The integral is equal to 0 without them.</p><p>We had a prime beef roast which was yummy and later that night we also made a delicious batch of pretzels. Incredibly, I was able to figure out how to do a four way braid without ever doing one before, and putting it into a pretzel form! Nice and salty.</p><p>After getting the coffee jitters out before bed, I slept almost completely uninterrupted in the cold until my 8am bio class.</p><p>Five guys was the play on the drive home,
Bye bye for now!</p></div></div><div class=post-divider><div><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2020-09-18-an-anniversary/>An anniversary</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span>Date</span> [

The burratta and country bread was delicious and I enjoyed eating there. The hotel was quite nice and since me and Lillian finished Scooby Doo Mystery incorporated this past Sunday (9/13/2020), we did a few crosswords and played Among Us.</p><p>Mystery Incorporated was an excellent show. The overarching plot alongside the classic scooby-doo mystery solving formula is very entertaining and gives something for everyone to enjoy.
